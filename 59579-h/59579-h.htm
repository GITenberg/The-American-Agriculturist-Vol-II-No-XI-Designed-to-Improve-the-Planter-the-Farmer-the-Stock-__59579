<h2><a name="FATTENING_POULTRY" id="FATTENING_POULTRY"></a>FATTENING POULTRY.</h2></div>


<p>As Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years,
are fast approaching, when the demand for poultry
is at its greatest height, and the quality of it is
more curiously considered than at other seasons
of the year, in order to obtain something choice
for the festive days, we have thought a few words
upon the fattening and preparation of it for market
might now very appropriately be given, and perhaps
interest our readers more than at another time.</p>

<p>The fowls being in good condition a fortnight to
one month previous to the time they are wanted
for killing, shut them up in a roomy, dry, well-ventilated,
and warm building, with either a
ground, stone, or plank floor, as is most convenient.
This should be cleaned every day, and straw several
inches thick spread over a part of it, especially
where geese and ducks are shut up, for the
purpose of giving them good beds to sit in. As
often as the litter gets soiled, remove it, and put
clean straw in its place. A constant supply of
food and water should now be kept before them,
allowing the fowls to eat and drink as often and
as much as they please. Gravel is indispensable
for their health, and charcoal, together with a little
lime or ground bones, is beneficial. Fowls
fat better when they can get at their food as often
as they please, and are not so apt to gorge themselves
and become surfeited.</p>

<p>For feed we prefer corn mostly; a little wheat,
rye, or barley, is also very well as a change; oats
have rather too much husk about them. In addition
to these, boiled potatoes, sweet apples, pumpkins,
and sugar beet, are excellent food, especially
when mixed with a due proportion of mush or
hasty pudding. Where sweet potatoes abound,
they are an excellent substitute for the last.
To the above, add daily a little lean meat, that
which is cooked is preferred; and the last week
of their fattening, for a finishing process, rice boiled
in milk and sweetened with molasses, is very
excellent. This may be called an expensive
method; but our readers may be assured that the
fowls will be enough better to pay for it. Meat
derives much of its taste from the kind and quality
of food that the animals consume; hence gross,
fatty substances, fish, or anything that is disagreeable
to the taste should be avoided in the food
given to fowls during the fattening process, as
these invariably impart more or less of their disagreeable
flavor to the flesh of the poultry fed upon
them. It is well known that the celebrated canvass-back
duck derives its delicacy of taste from
feeding on the bulbous roots of a peculiar grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
growing in the Chesapeake bay, and that other
kinds of ducks are scarcely eatable, in consequence
of their living almost entirely upon fish. These
remarks will hold good to most kinds of birds,
both of the water and land, and, indeed, of all
animals; accordingly as their food is good or
bad, so will be the quality of the milk, meat, or
eggs.</p>

<p>We recollect when a boy, of having occasionally
seen geese and ducks nailed through the webs of
their feet to planks and floors, and hens and turkeys
tied up and so closely confined to stakes, that
they could not exercise. This was done so that
they might fat the faster! How shockingly barbarous,
and any one guilty of such a practice in
these days, ought to be indicted, and severely punished
for their cruelty and cupidity. We are totally
opposed to the close confinement of beast or
bird. Without exercise, the system can not be in
a healthy state; and the meat of close confined
animals is never as good, to say the least of it, as
when they have plenty of fresh air, and are allowed
to move moderately about.</p>

<p>The best method of killing fowls, is to cut their
heads off at a single blow with a sharp axe, and
then hang them up and allow them to bleed freely.
By this process they never know what hurts them,
or endure pain for a second. Wringing the necks
of poultry is almost as shocking as nailing their
feet to planks for the purpose of fattening them,
and follows in the same barbarous category.</p>

<p>Scalding the fowl previous to picking, injures
the feathers, and makes it troublesome to dry them,
and we think the quality of flesh is somewhat injured
by this process, especially if the weather be
not pretty cold at the time. They should be picked
as soon as possible after being killed, and their
offal taken from them; be clean rinsed then in
cold water, and hung up to dry, and kept as
separate as possible till sold; packing them together
in heaps injures the flesh. To be hung up
and frozen for a few days, or even weeks before
eating, makes the flesh more tender. To keep
them the same length of time after roasting, especially
if well stuffed, also adds to their delicacy
of taste and tenderness.</p>

<p>When the bird is brought on to the table, it is
perfectly shocking to see its head, legs, and feet,
left upon it, though we know in many places this
is fashionable, and considered highly genteel; but
for our own part we detest such offal, and the
sight of them frequently destroys our appetite for
the time being. The process of carving also at
the table is a dead bore. We like the French
fashion of cutting up the bird in the kitchen or at
a side table, and having it passed round on the
dish, every one then helping himself to such pieces
as he likes best.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="FERTILITY_OF_SEA-MUD" id="FERTILITY_OF_SEA-MUD"></a>FERTILITY OF SEA-MUD.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Sea-mud</span> varies greatly in its composition, dependant
something upon the soil of the neighboring
uplands. It is considered a valuable manure
in Europe, and is sought for with avidity, and
transported not unfrequently considerable distances
into the interior. We have seen it used with
good effect in the United States, from Massachusetts
to Pennsylvania; and are told that in Delaware
and Maryland, and even farther south, it is
highly prized by those who have tried it. On
Long Island, the past summer, we were occasionally
shown the fertilising results, not only of sea-mud,
but of the marsh soil also, applied to the
uplands a little removed from the borders of the
marshes and the seashore. Our intelligent correspondent,
Mr. Partridge, informs us he has used
beach-mud in various ways with good effect; and
that the past summer, two gentlemen whose
country seats border his mill, were allowed to
make use of the sediment from the tide mill-pond,
and they found it added greatly to the productiveness
of their gardens.</p>

<p>Sea-mud may be applied in different ways, according
to its constituents. If it abounds with
clay, it should be taken in the fall of the year, and
spread broad-cast upon the land, and thus lie exposed
to the action of the frost all winter. This
pulverises it well, and in the spring of the year
the roller should be passed over it in dry weather,
followed by the harrow, and if any lumps remain
after this operation, let them be beaten fine with
the dung-beater. This is considered one of the
best top dressings for grass land which can be given;
it also answers well to be plowed in for either
grain or root crops. Where the mud abounds more
with sand, it is an excellent thing to put into barn
yards and pig-styes, to be incorporated with the
litter and manure; it may likewise be thrown into
a heap until it becomes completely pulverised, and
then spread upon the land.</p>

<p>As air-slacked lime or small broken lime can be
obtained in this city for about half the price of
quick lime, Mr. Partridge suggests that it would
be an excellent ingredient to mix with the sea-mud,
for the purpose of forming a compost. A
bushel or two of the lime, to a cart-load of the
mud, he thinks a good mixture. When it abounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
with considerable vegetable matter, we would
recommend a greater proportion of lime, say from
one to ten or twenty parts. Ashes and charcoal
dust are excellent ingredients to mix with sea-mud,
and when either of these or lime is used to form a
compost, they make it much more lasting. It is
less labor to transport the sea-mud directly to the
place where it is to be used, and spread it broad-cast
at once upon the land; and as the saving of
labor is quite an object in our country, we have
found that this method of applying it is the most
generally practised.</p>

<p>With the exception of a few of our more intelligent
farmers, sea-mud and marsh-mud as fertilizers,
are not valued as highly as they ought to be
in the United States. They exist in immense
quantities all along our seaboard, and may be had
in an unlimited extent for the mere labor of transportation.
We hope that some experiments may
hereafter be made with them by some of our readers
on the different kinds of crops, and that they
will give us the results. The time, we think, is
approaching, when sea-mud and marsh-soil will
be as highly prized here as they now are in Europe.</p>

<h2><a name="SKETCHES_OF_THE_WEST_NO_II" id="SKETCHES_OF_THE_WEST_NO_II"></a>SKETCHES OF THE WEST.&mdash;NO. II.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Plantation of Mr. Grey.</span>&mdash;One of the best
plantations, especially for its farm-buildings, which
we visited in Kentucky, was that of Mr. Benjamin
Grey of Versailles. The house, as is usual in the
more southern states, stands near the centre of the
domain on rising ground, and commands a fine
view of the country around. It is in cottage style,
large and roomy, and flanked by thick, strong
chimneys, built up outside of the gable ends. A
pretty yard of smooth green-sward, decked with
shrubbery and evergreens, is enclosed around with
pointed white palings, and adjoining this is a noble
park, formed by merely underbrushing and thinning
out a few of the trees of the original forest.
These are usually termed wood-land pastures in
Kentucky; yet in most instances, they better deserve
the name of park, than many of those on noblemen's
estates in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crops</span>.&mdash;Mr. Grey's farm being principally devoted
to stock, and what is rather unusual here,
dairy products, the crops are but a secondary consideration.
Hemp is the main one to which he
gives his attention; and in addition to this, he
raises a sufficiency of corn and the smaller grains for
his own consumption. The rotation is much like
that described in our first volume, under head of
Tours in Kentucky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stock</span>.&mdash;This is very fine indeed, Mr. Grey having
been highly spirited in this matter. His Short-Horns
are choice, and quite numerous. We particularly
admired the cow Mary Ann, with the
calf at her foot. She has a fashionable and airy
form; an up-head, and deer-like action; handles
well, and in addition to all these, we were informed
that she is an excellent milker. Three heifers
of her produce we also admired; the two youngest
were strikingly like their dam. After the Short-Horns,
we were shown a few good Cotswold, and
South-Down sheep, imported direct from England
by Messrs. Bagg &amp; Wait of Orange Co., in this
state. The stock-hogs are a cross of the Berkshire
upon the Thin-Rinds, (a grade Chinese), and they
make excellent porkers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farm Buildings.</span>&mdash;These are among the most
complete we have seen in any place, and we speak
of them with the more pleasure, because they are
blameably deficient in farm buildings throughout
the whole southwest. The climate here, it is true,
is warmer and much more open than at the north;
but it is in this <i>very openness</i>, that consists the
principal suffering of the stock. The ground during
this time is muddy, cold, and damp; and worse,
consequently, for animals to repose upon, than
when frozen dry, or covered with snow. Sudden
changes are continually taking place. Mild weather
prevails for a few days, relaxing the system;
this is then followed not unfrequently by intense
cold; the thermometer sinking in 48 hours from
55° or 60° above, to zero, and sometimes 8° to 10°
below it. These sudden changes are very injurious
to man and beast, and far more to be dreaded
than the steady cold of northern latitudes; and for
this reason, more attention should be paid to the
warmth of their dress on the part of the people
here, and to the housing of stock, than is generally
done. It would lessen disease, add to their longevity,
and give a handsomer, fuller, and more
healthful physical appearance. But to return more
immediately to our subject.</p>

<p>With the exception of the usually reserved gangway
on the barn-floor, the lower story is devoted
to stables. These are planked, and each animal
is accommodated with a separate stall. Behind
them is a shallow gutter, running the whole length
of the stable, which conducts the liquid falling
from the animals into a cess-pool in the yard, and
is there absorbed by muck. The solid manure is
also equally carefully saved and applied to the
land, and notwithstanding the proverbial fertility
of the soil of Kentucky, Mr. Grey assured us that
he considered himself well paid in the increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
his crops, for the labor employed in thus saving
and applying his manure. Over-head in the barn
are lofts for hay and straw; a straw-cutter to prepare
them for feeding; cribs and bins for grain;
and a large square box with heavy wooden pounders,
for the hands to pound up corn and cob into
meal on rainy days, when they can do nothing
else. This cob-meal is usually mixed up with
water, and allowed to stand till it ferments, and is
then fed to the stock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dairy.</span>&mdash;This is a sufficiently roomy building,
of one story, situated in a little dell a short
distance from the mansion. One of the gable ends
abuts against a nearly perpendicular cliff, out of
which bursts a clear gurgling spring, that takes its
course through the centre of the rocky floor of the
dairy, and then finds its way into the valley below.
Here is every convenience for making butter
and cheese, in which Mr. Grey excels. We
have dwelt thus minutely on the plantation, stock,
and buildings of Mr. Grey, because we consider
them an excellent example to follow in Kentucky;
and also for the purpose of giving our northern
readers a general idea of the husbandry at the
west, of which the great majority entertain the
most indefinite notions imaginable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Hart's Plantation.</span>&mdash;After taking an early
dinner, Mr. Grey ordered up his buggy, and we
started for Mr. Nathaniel Hart's. This was some
few miles off, yet in order to get there we paid no
attention to the public roads, but took our way
over gentle hill and dale, through woodland-pastures,
and among fields containing a hundred acres
or more in each, under a single fence. For the
purpose of opening and shutting the field-gates as
we passed, we were accompanied by an ebony urchin,
as out-rider, mounted on the bare back of a
high-spirited gray nag, which he rode with no little
address. This seemed quite a gala business
for him; and bare-headed, with his thick woolly
locks fluttering in the wind, and his shirt-collar
wide open, he went grinning along, now advancing
at a hard gallop, and anon closing up at a fast trot,
swinging open and shutting to the gates, shaking
his pate, and hallooing to every animal that he
thought did not move with sufficient alacrity from
our destined path.</p>

<p>"Yo! ho! So you no move, Misser Cow&mdash;then
Pompey make you," and at her he charged, brandishing
a long stick, like a Cossack of the Don
with his spear, the gray nag at the same time laying
back his ears, and opening his mouth, and
showing his teeth, as if grinning in fiery sympathy
with his redoubtable rider, and ready to devour the
animal that so sluggishly obstructed the path.

Pompey following up their career a short distance,
singing with high satisfaction:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Hart's plantation is a very fine one, and he
is one of the largest hemp-growers in Kentucky.
He has done much to introduce a system of water-rotting
hemp in ponds, which we think is the best
and most simple of the kind yet tried. He has
promised us a description of this, with his late improvements,
and we trust that we shall be favored
with it soon, for the benefit of those desirous of
preparing their hemp for market by the pond-water-rotting
process. There is so much in common
with Kentucky plantations, that it is unnecessary
to dwell further upon particulars. Mr. Hart's
stock of cattle is principally derived from the first
importation of the Short-Horns into Kentucky, in
1817. He keeps a flock of about 800 Merino sheep,
which, low as wool is, he thinks make him as
good, if not a better return, than anything else
which his plantation produces. Sheep-husbandry
is attracting much attention at present in Kentucky.
It is a very superior region indeed, for
sheep, and if the planters would go judiciously into
the fine-woolled breeds, wool would soon become
an article of large export with them, and a source
of considerable profit. Let it be remembered, that
the cheaper and better wool can be produced, the
more there will be consumed of it; and the cheaper
and better, woollen cloths will be furnished in
return. We need not fear overstocking the country
in our generation.</p>

<p>Mr. Hart keeps quite a herd of deer in his
park, and several head of elk. These last, with
their large branching horns, and lofty, erect heads,
have a noble appearance. He formerly had a few
buffaloes, but they became so troublesome in breaking
down fences, and sallying out whenever they
pleased, to the great terror of the country round,
that he was at last obliged to kill them. Buffalo
bulls get somewhat ferocious as they grow old,
and are rather dangerous animals on the plantation.
While in Kentucky, we picked up some
comic anecdotes of their doings as they turned out;
but a feather's weight in the other scale might
have made them equally tragical; and upon the
whole, unless enclosed within a fence that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
could not break down, we should advise our
friends to eschew keeping buffaloes.</p>

<h2><a name="BREEDS_OF_FOWLS" id="BREEDS_OF_FOWLS"></a>BREEDS OF FOWLS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> perusing the American Poultry Book, which
we noticed in our October No., we find the following
recommendation for selecting a stock for the
poultry-yard:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The better practice would seem to be, in order
to make the poultry-yard most profitable, to select
<i>no particular breed</i>. Commence with pullets and
cocks of the first year, of all the breeds mentioned
above, except bantams, and without any regard to
color excepting those of a pure white. It would
be well, if possible, to select the cocks from the
same yard. Every year exchange a nest-full of
eggs with your neighbors, or such as have good
fowls. By pursuing steadily this practice of exchanging
eggs, you will yearly infuse new blood
into your stock, and avoid the inconvenience of
breeding in and in. Without being aware of this
fact, many farmers find their stock <i>running out</i>,
&amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now the above plan for forming a stock for the
poultry-yard we hold to be perfectly absurd, and
one might with just the same propriety, advise
mingling all the different breeds of horses or cattle
together, for the purpose of forming a good
stock, as the different varieties of fowls; and we
need only consider for one moment, the incongruity
of the materials which form them, to be convinced
of this. There is the pugnacious Gamecock;
the pheasant-shaped Top-knot; the coarse
Malay; the thick-skinned Negro-fowl; the tender
Chinese or Merino; the tailless Rumpless; the
Friesland, with reversed feathers; the short-legged
Creeper; the five-toed Dorking; &amp;c., &amp;c.; all
thrown into one helter-skelter mass, the progeny
of which would prove as contemptible a race of
mongrels as ever graced a dung-hill, and beyond
the precincts of a dung-hill they would scarcely be
worth removing.</p>

<p>Those who have most eminently succeeded in
breeding fowls, have adopted the same course in
doing so, which is followed by judicious breeders
of animals; and that is, by sticking to the breed,
when it is a good one, in its utmost purity; choosing
the best of the flock from which to propagate,
and thus continuing. In-and-in breeding, to a certain
extent, when pursued by those who thoroughly
understand their business, has been productive of
the best results. The finest, the largest, and the
most <i>indomitable</i> game-cocks have thus been bred;
and if we possessed a good breed of poultry of any
kind, we should be very careful how we exchanged
eggs with our neighbors for the purpose of improving
them. If they had a superior stock to our
own, of the same breed, we would select from
among them grown birds only; we should then
know what we got, and be able to make improvements
upon those we already possessed. It is by
mingling all sorts of breeds together, without any
definite notion as to the results, that "many farmers
find their stock <i>running out</i>"; and if every
one were to follow this course, we should soon be
without a single good fowl in our poultry-yards.
We really regret to see a book like this on American
Poultry, which in the main is a good little work,
recommend such a course of breeding; for in our
humble judgment it is the very worst which could
be pursued.</p>

<p>We can not say that we much like the author's
advice either, as to the choice of a cock. Why he
should be "restless, not very large, with a thick and
stout bill, long spurs," &amp;c., we can not divine. The
best cocks we ever kept, and those of the most indomitable
courage, when fighting was necessary,
were the most quiet, attentive, and polite in their
seraglio: they were also of rather large size for
their breed; with fine heads, bills, feet, and legs.</p>

<h2><a name="NEW_YORK_FARMERS_CLUB" id="NEW_YORK_FARMERS_CLUB"></a>NEW YORK FARMERS' CLUB.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Farmers</span>' Club resumed their meetings, on
Tuesday, Nov. 13th, at the Repository of the American
Institute.</p>

<p>The meeting commenced by reading a communication
from the President of the Manhattan Gas
Light Company, David C. Colden, Esq., inviting
the attention of farmers, and all interested in agriculture,
to the value of the refuse of gas-works as
manure. Extracts from the works of Liebig, and
Johnston were then read, setting forth the powerful
fertilizing properties of ammoniacal liquor,
with which the refuse of gas-works is found to be
strongly impregnated. After some conversation
on the subject, in which Mr. Stevens, Commodore
De Kay, Mr. Meigs, and Mr. Wakeman, took part,
as to the best method of disposing of this communication,
it was resolved that it be referred to
a committee consisting of Gen. Tallmadge, Mr.
Prince, Gen. Johnson, Col. Clarke, and Mr. Townsend,
to report at the next meeting of the club.</p>

<p>Mr. William R. Prince, of Flushing, presented
to the meeting, specimens of nineteen different varieties
of apples, among which were several of
very large size and superior quality.</p>

<p>Mr. Meigs presented seeds of a new variety of
squash, the <i>Cucurbitur bicolor</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward, cuttings from a vine which produced
ripe Isabella grapes on the 5th September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>A desultory conversation then ensued as to the
future proceedings of the club. Much diversity of
opinion appeared to exist as to the propriety of
holding the meetings weekly, fortnightly, or monthly,
when a committee was appointed to report upon
the subject.</p>

<p>Dr. Field next called the attention of the club to
a subject which he considered deserving their serious
attention, viz: the present condition of the
children now in the alms-house on Long Island.
He thought they might be employed advantageously
to themselves and the public, either in the
cultivation of the mulberry, and general management
of silk, or in horticultural occupations. He
then proceeded to describe with feeling eloquence,
their present deplorable condition, both morally
and physically, arising from the system of idleness
they are now allowed to pursue.</p>

<p>He was followed by Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Carter,
who both agreed that it was high time some
steps should be taken to ameliorate the condition
of the poor children, and it was finally resolved:</p>

<p>That a committee consisting of Dr. Field, Mr.
Stevens, and Mr. Carter, be appointed to investigate
the subject, and petition the corporation that
the pauper children of this city, now on the Long
Island farm, be employed in horticultural pursuits
generally, and also in the raising and manufacture
of silk.</p>

<p>Mr. Stevens then made some remarks on the subject
of wax-flowers and fruits, a specimen of which
was exhibited by Mr. Lane. Mr. Stevens thought
that a model of every new variety of fruit ought
to be taken in wax, and preserved at the Repository
of the Institute.</p>

<p>A motion was made and carried that the executive
committee be instructed to consider the subject.</p>

<p>Gen. Tallmadge suggested that a list of donors
of fruits, &amp;c., be kept by the secretary, and placed
on the records of the club at every meeting, which
was unanimously agreed to.</p>

<p>The meeting then adjourned to Tuesday, the
28th November.</p>

<p>The following are the extracts on refuse gas,
sent to the club by the President of the Manhattan
Gas-Light Company:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the properties of manure, and its agency upon
the growth of the vegetable world, can be explained
by chemistry, we shall find the ammoniacal
liquor produced in gas-works, to be a valuable
substitute for those manures, by the application of
which it is intended to supply the soil with nitrogen.</p>

<p>"One of the most valuable manures is urine,
and its excellence depends almost entirely upon
the ammoniacal salts which it holds in solution.
The relative value of urine as manure, depends
upon the quantity of nitrogen the different kinds
yield. Thus human urine is the most esteemed,
and that of horned animals the least."&mdash;<i>Clegg's
Treatise on Gas-Making.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>According to Liebig, 547 pounds of human excrement
contain 16.41 pounds of nitrogen; a quantity
sufficient to yield the nitrogen of 800 pounds of
wheat, rye, oats, or of 900 pounds of barley. How
much more, then, will be supplied from an equal
weight of ammoniacal liquor!</p>

<p>Mr. J. Watson, the manager of the gas-works
at Kirriemuir, has favored me with the following
facts:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The ammoniacal liquor on the surface of the
tar-well has been found a very great improvement
as a manure for raising crops of grass in this
quarter, by being sprinkled on the field in the
same way as water is put on public streets in large
towns, to keep down dust in dry weather. I have
myself seen an experiment of this tried, and can
say that part of a field of grass sprinkled in this
way, after the first cutting, was far superior to any
other part of the field receiving manure of any
other kind, and that the part so sprinkled, or
showered over, was ready to be cut down a second
time in the course of between fourteen days and
three weeks; whereas, the other part of the field
cut at the same time, was only beginning to spring
or rise from the roots in that time. It must be
mixed up before use with four parts of common
water. In particular, the said experiment of the
gas-water has been used by David Nairn, Esq.,
Doumkilba, near Meigle, in this neighborhood,
with success; and I am informed that he has purchased
and taken a lease of the ammoniacal liquor
from different gas-companies in this country.</p>

<p>"I am convinced much good might be derived
from different qualities of the refuse products of
gas-works as manure. An inquiry into this subject
would remunerate the engineer or agriculturist
to the full, and would besides confer a considerable
benefit upon his fellows, and give that practical
proof of the correctness of a theory so welcome
to the man of science."</p>

<p>"The fertilizing power of gypsum has been explained
by its supposed action on the ammonia
which is presumed to exist in the atmosphere. If
this be the true explanation, a substance containing
ammonia should act <i>at least</i> as energetically.
At all events, the action of foldyard manure and
of putrid urine, is supposed to depend chiefly on
the ammonia they contain or give off.</p>

<p>"Now among the substances containing ammonia
in large quantity, the ammoniacal liquor of the
gas-works is one which can easily be obtained,
and can be applied in a liquid state at very little
cost. It must be previously diluted with water
till its taste and smell become scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>"I would propose therefore, as a further experiment,
that along with one or more of the substances
above mentioned, the ammoniacal liquor of the
gas-works should be tried, on a measured portion
of ground, and, if possible, in the same field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Soot as a manure is supposed to act partly, if
not chiefly in consequence of the ammonia it contains.
In Gloucestershire, it is applied to potatoes
and to wheat, chiefly to the latter, and with great
success. In the wolds of Yorkshire it is also applied
largely to the wheat-crop. In this country
it is frequently used on grass land. I am not aware
that it is extensively used on clover. I am inclined
to anticipate that the sulphur it contains, in addition
to ammonia, would render it useful to this
plant. At all events comparative experiments in
the same field with the gypsum and the ammoniacal
liquor, are likely to lead to interesting results.</p>

<p>* * * "Of ammoniacal liquor 100 or 200
gallons per acre, according to its strength, for this
is constantly varying. It must also be diluted
with so large a quantity of water as will render
it perfectly tasteless, and is likely to prove most
beneficial if laid on at several successive periods."&mdash;<i>Johnston's
Agricultural Chemistry</i>, part 1.</p>

<p>"Sal ammoniac is probably too expensive an article
to be employed; but sulphate of ammonia
may be had of the wholesale chemist at a price
considerably more reasonable, and the ammoniacal
liquor of the gas-manufactories, through the
distillation of coal, is a still cheaper commodity."&mdash;<i>Liebig's
Agricultural Chemistry.</i></p>

<p>"Its efficacy as a manure is vouched for by many
who have made trial of it upon their land. See a
communication by Mr. Paynter on gas-water as a
manure."&mdash;<i>Journal Royal Ag. Soc.</i>, No. 1.</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="THE_NEXT_ANNUAL_SHOW_OF_THE_STATE" id="THE_NEXT_ANNUAL_SHOW_OF_THE_STATE"></a>THE NEXT ANNUAL SHOW OF THE STATE
AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.</h2></div>


<p>As the annual show of the New York State Agricultural
Society is now sure to bring fifteen to
twenty thousand strangers into the place where it
may be held, to pass three or four days there, and
spend their money pretty freely, it has become
quite an object with the different towns situated
on the great thoroughfares, to have the exhibitions
within their boundaries as often as possible. Strong
movements will be made for these hereafter; but
we trust that the Society will weigh well the different
claims preferred for its favor, and that no
other consideration than the public good, and the
spread of its influence, will have weight in its decisions.</p>

<p>Albany, Syracuse, and Rochester, each having
had the advantage of one of these meetings, other
towns now are soliciting the like favor; and among
those which are preferring their claims for the
show of 1844, we understand that Buffalo, Utica,
and Poughkeepsie, are the most prominent. Perhaps
as the northern and western parts of the State
have now had the benefit of three of the exhibitions
of the Society, it is no more than fair that
some attention be paid to the southern and eastern
portions. We have heard this city named as a
very suitable place for the show of next year, and
the only objection we can anticipate to it is, that
it is an extreme end of the State. Granted; and
is not Buffalo the same? Yet, notwithstanding
this, we contend that New York or Buffalo is
just as fairly entitled in their turn to one of the
exhibitions of the Society, as Albany, Syracuse, or
Rochester. However, as our own interests might
be somewhat served by a meeting of the State Society
in this city, we shall waive advocating its
claims to one for the present, and content ourselves
with stating those of Poughkeepsie.</p>

<p>1. This town is 210 miles by the usual travelled
route, northwest from Montauk Point, the
southeast end of the State. This is as great a
distance as from Poughkeepsie to Syracuse, and
41 miles further than the railroad route, though a
circuitous one, from Syracuse to Buffalo; so that
it may fairly be said to be the hither-end of a
third-part of the limits of the State.</p>

<p>2. The population, from Dutchess county, south
and east, includes about one fourth of that of the
whole State.</p>

<p>3. Poughkeepsie is easy of access by land or
water, and being situated on the Hudson, hundreds
of strangers from the neighboring States, especially
the southern ones, would visit a show here,
when they could hardly be induced to go farther
north or west, and as these visiters are always
purchasers to a greater or less extent, it is quite
an object to get them to attend.</p>

<p>4. This town is the capital of one of the oldest,
wealthiest, and most populous counties of the
State, and the one whose general system of agriculture
is probably more highly advanced than
any other. Dutchess, and the neighboring counties,
have also considerable improved stock&mdash;much
more than we had any idea of till our recent excursions
in these parts. Durham, Devon, and
Ayrshire cattle abound; superior road and blood
horses; Cotswold, Leicester, South Down, and
numerous flocks of Merino sheep; the products of
the dairy; agricultural implements, and roots,
seeds, fruits, flowers, and domestic fabrics.</p>

<p>5. Poughkeepsie is ready at her own expense,
to build pens for the stock, and furnish all other
needful accommodation for the Society, which will
be a saving of expense to it of at least $1,000.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is more accumulated wealth in
the southern, than other parts of the State, and
the Society, by holding a fair proportion of its
shows in this quarter, will make itself many
staunch friends, and be introduced to thousands,
who would otherwise be ignorant of its great pub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>lic
merits. The Agricultural Society of the State
of New York is looked up to as an example
throughout the country, and it should be careful to
avoid even the appearance of being partial or local
in its proceedings. The national societies of Great
Britain and Ireland, adopt the course of holding
their shows in, not only the central, but the extreme
parts of the kingdom; and this is one great
reason of their popularity among all classes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thinking</span> that our readers had become somewhat
satiated with so much upon foreign matters
as have hitherto found place in this journal, we
had desisted for several months past, giving
sketches of the agriculture of England; but having
recently received so many solicitations to continue
them, we again take up the subject, and
shall pursue it pretty regularly through the whole
of our third volume, if such seems to be the pleasure
of a majority of our subscribers. Perhaps, to
these, we may also add sketches of some things
we saw in Russia, the recollections of which are
very pleasant, at least to us, yet whether we shall
make them equally so in relating them to others,
remains to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chatsworth, Seat of the Duke of Devonshire.</span>&mdash;In
returning from Yorkshire to London on
the North Midland railroad, we stopped at the
Chesterfield station, for the purpose of making an
excursion to Chatsworth, to view the celebrated
gardens and immense conservatory of this superb
place. It was a raw morning in August, and as
we jumped from a confined seat in the rail-coach,
we were glad to be on our feet once more, and
have an opportunity of rousing our blood by a
smart walk from the station into the town. We
stopped at the Angel inn, took a hearty breakfast,
and while waiting a gig being made ready to convey
us to Chatsworth, stepped out for a stroll over
the place. Chesterfield is a dingy old town, of
about 6,000 inhabitants, and has little to recommend
it to the notice of strangers, save the spire
of All Saints' Church. This rises to the height
of 230 feet, is curiously channeled, and covered
with lead, and is so much out of perpendicular, as
to attract marked attention in passing it, even
when at a considerable distance. It being market-day,
the town was thronged with farmers
from the country, exposing stock and agricultural
products in the square for sale. There was little
in these, however, deserving particular attention,
and after giving them a hasty look, we returned
to the inn. As we came up, a dapper waiter announced
the "oss and gig as <i>h</i>all ready;" when
in we jumped, and set out for Chatsworth at a
round pace, distant, if we recollect right, about 8
miles.</p>

<p>Derbyshire possesses the wildest and most broken
scenery of any county in England, and after
passing over the flat surface of Yorkshire, it was
quite a relief to find ourselves trotting up and
down along a road winding picturesquely around
high hills, and over deep narrow dales. An
hour's drive or so, brought us to the pretty little
village of Edensor, close by the inn of which, is
the entrance to Chatsworth. The village is situated
within the park, and is the property of the
Duke, and certainly it is the most charming one
we ever saw. Every cottage is of stone, and no
two alike in their architecture. One is a mimic
Gothic castle; another a cottage ornèe; a third in
the Elizabethan, a fourth in the Swiss, and perhaps
a fifth in the Tudor style. Everything then
was so complete about them&mdash;the pretty gardens
full of flowers&mdash;the hedges so neatly trimmed&mdash;the
yards, laid down with the greenest and softest of
turf, and the shrubbery so tastefully planted!
These were the residences of the laborers on the
estate, the possession of which any one might envy
them, and desire to be able to call his home. Attached
to the village is a fine old church, and
around it an ample yard, handsomely walled in
with strong mason-work. Altogether, this village
is quite a gem in its way, and we were going
to add, an epitome of its owner's heart; for on all
his estates, whether in England or Ireland, the
Duke of Devonshire has made it a point to protect
and bountifully provide for his people. There is
no want, or suffering, or seeking the poor-house,
by the tenantry, allowed by this kind-hearted, benevolent
man.</p>

<p>Turning from Edensor, and ascending a mound-like
hill to the left of the carriage-road, the palace
and the grounds of Chatsworth appear to the
greatest advantage. Immediately below is the
river Derwent, tracing its sparkling course through
a rich vale, where were perhaps 1,500 deer browsing
or taking their gambols. A handsome stone
bridge spans the river, and just beyond, the ground
rises in terraces to a narrow plain, where stand
the noble palace, with its out-buildings, and the
immense conservatory, in magnificent grandeur.
Back of these rises a lofty hill, the steep sides of
which are thickly planted with forest-trees, and
the summit is crowned with a high tower of octagonal
shape, built of stone. We were received at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
the palace-gate by a servant in handsome livery,
and passing into the gallery of the court, a fine
hearty girl made her appearance to conduct us
over the building. The front of the palace is
350 feet, and one of the side wings about 400 feet
long, and this whole area contains a series of
apartments called the drawing-room suite. An
entire number of this paper would hardly suffice
to give the reader a complete description of these
magnificent rooms, and the treasures of art they
contain, we therefore pass them over in silence.
From these we strolled into the orangery, which
is about 30 feet wide, and 200 feet long. It is full
of beautiful exotics, and among them were several
specimens of the Rhododendron Arboreum, which
bore, the preceding summer, over 2,000 flowers.
We now walked out to the lawn in front of the
palace, where one of the under-gardeners appeared
to conduct us over the grounds. These are extremely
beautiful, with walled terraces in the
Italian style, and fountains. One jet d'eau throws
up a column 90 feet high. But the great show
here in the way of water-works, is the cascade.
It is entirely artificial, and must have been made
at a great expense. The water rushes out from
a series of lakes on top of the hill, and comes
pouring down its side, taking a leap of about 80
feet from one of the arches, and then falls for a
length of 300 yards over a series of 24 ledges, and
disappears amidst masses of rock, on the edge of
the lawn. Here it finds a subterranean passage
to the river Derwent. These water-works are
looked upon by some critics with affected contempt;
not so with us, however, we greatly admired
them in their way; and yet we have seen
Niagara a thousand times, and had a peep at most
of the other water-falls worth looking at in the
United States. We have no sympathy with such
hypercritics as profess a distaste to the cascade at
Chatsworth: as a work of art, it is a magnificent
thing, and to our eye, in keeping with the palace
and grounds; and we viewed it with interest. A
bronze tree a little farther on, excited still greater
curiosity with us than the cascade, for it was
made to act the part of a fountain, by throwing
water from a thousand sprigs and leaves all around
in a shower of spray.</p>

<p>But leaving this and the exquisite scenery of the
lawn, we passed on by a winding carriage-road to
a short distance to the conservatory. This was
350 feet long, 150 feet wide, and nearly 70 feet
high; and when fully completed, is to have an additional
length of 150 feet. The roof is an arch,
and is covered with plate glass of the best kind,
and so thick as to resist the heaviest hail. It is
heated by iron tubes of hot water, and to these are
added others for cold water, and the whole, if
stretched out to a single length, we were informed
would extend nearly six miles. The plants and
trees here are distributed in open borders, each
class being placed in the soil most proper for it,
and the temperature so regulated as to suit their
natural state as nearly as possible. Not far from
the centre is an immense rockery rising about 50
feet high, and from the fissures of the thick
slabs of stone that compose it, the cactus and other
plants grow out as in their natural state. Half
way up this huge precipice is a little lake with
islets, and in this, water-lilies and other aquatic
plants of the rarest and most beautiful kinds. A
wild goat path leads to the top of the rockery, and
beneath it is a wide, deep cave. The variety of
shrubs and plants in this immense conservatory is
very great; some of the trees already reach nearly
to the top of the roof, and others presented dimensions
gigantic in the extreme for those within a
green-house. There are wide folding-doors at
each end of the conservatory, and any time he
pleases, the Duke can have a drive with his coach
and four horses through it. Taking it altogether,
it is by far the most magnificent thing of the kind
we have ever seen. The whole cost of it is not
less than half a million of dollars, which is but a
little over the present annual income of its wealthy
possessor.</p>

<p>After leaving the conservatory, we took a zig-zag
road, and ascended through the forest to the
crown of the hill by the octagonal tower. A peasant
family was residing here, who permitted us
to ascend it to the top. The view from this is no
less extensive than beautiful, of Chatsworth and
the wild broken country around. Descending from
this high perch we had quite a chat with the peasant's
wife. She informed us that the tower was
built by a predecessor of the present Duke, for the
purpose of giving the ladies at the palace an opportunity
of seeing the fox-hunting which formerly
took place at Chatsworth. Upon taking leave,
the good woman directed a little rosy-faced daughter
to show us the lakes on the hill, the sources
of the cascade and fountains below. After something
of a stroll through the woods, we found two
large expanses of water belted in by thick rows of
the larch and fir, and apparently as isolated as if
in a wild forest of our own country. The white
swan and the black are kept here, and most other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
kinds of curious water-fowl. Our pretty guide
answered all our inquiries with intelligence, and
at parting we gave her a small guerdon, for which
she returned a grateful "thank'e zur" and a low
courtesy, and then, with the lightness of a young
fawn, skipped into the woods, and immediately disappeared.
Descending the hill toward the palace
we came to the stables. These are very extensive,
of quadrangular shape, and large courtyards
within. At a distance, with their imposing
architecture, they might almost pass for the palace
itself.</p>

<p>We now bent our steps to the house of the celebrated
Mr. Paxton, the head gardener of the Duke
of Devonshire, editor of the Magazine of Botany
which bears his name, and one of the first botanists
of England. His residence is within the park,
about a quarter of a mile from the palace, and is
a roomy, beautiful cottage, completely enveloped
in flowers and flowering shrubbery, with a handsome
little conservatory at the end. Much to our
regret, he was not at home; but a sub-gardener,
quite an intelligent man, volunteered to show us
the gardens. They occupy 12 acres, and are enclosed
by a thick, brick wall, about twelve feet
high. Here are the experimental and kitchen
gardens, and hundreds of fruit-bearing espaliers,
trained up the walls. In addition to these there
are forcing pits in abundance, and upward of
20 hot-houses, about 300 feet long each, devoted
to different purposes, one of the most extensive of
which is the growing of pine apples. All these
things may be considered very extravagant, but in
supporting them, the Duke of Devonshire has done
much for the cause of science, and has conferred a
lasting benefit on his country.</p>

<p>We left Chatsworth with regret; the day we
spent there we would have gladly prolonged to a
week, and then we should have gained but an imperfect
knowledge of the treasures of nature and
art which are stored up here for the admiration
of thousands of visiters. Mary Queen of Scots
was some time a prisoner here; so also was Marshal
Tallard, who was captured at the battle of
Blenheim. What were the thoughts of the beautiful
Queen upon taking leave of it, history does
not record; but the Marshal, no less gracefully
than happily, said: "When I return to France
and reckon up the days of my captivity in England,
I shall leave out all those I have spent at Chatsworth."
And so thought we, pausing on the
mound-like hill again, as we retraced our steps to
Edensor, and cast a last lingering look upon the
park, and palace, and forest hills in the background,
lit up by the clear, glorious sun just sinking
beneath the horizon.</p>

<h2><a name="AGRICULTURAL_SHOWS" id="AGRICULTURAL_SHOWS"></a>AGRICULTURAL SHOWS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The Philadelphia Society</span> held its annual show
at the Lamb tavern, October 4, 5, and 6. The
Germantown Telegraph states, in the <i>Report of
the Committee of Arrangements</i>, that the display
of horses was unusually attractive, exhibiting the
various breeds for the turf, road, and farm, in considerable
numbers. The Durham cattle seem at
last to be getting the better of prejudice in that
quarter, and in their superior forms and deep milking
qualities, have shamed nearly everything else
from the ground, save a few fine Devons and capital
grade Durham milkers. Of sheep and swine,
there were very few present, which is the more
to be regretted, as these animals exist in considerable
numbers and of superior breeds throughout
the neighboring counties of Montgomery, Delaware,
Chester, and Lancaster. Of Agricultural
Implements and Products there was a good show,
and the Plowing-Match proved an interesting affair.
Peter A. Browne, Esq., delivered the address,
which we find at length in the Farmers'
Cabinet. Among other things, he contends no
less strenuously than justly for the establishment
of Agricultural schools and Professorships. From
another part of the address we subjoin a few suggestions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>First, then, it is feared that our agricultural
friends have not yet paid <i>all</i> the attention that the
subject demands, to a judicious rotation of crops,
adapted to our climate; particularly in regard to
<i>roots</i>.</p>

<p>Second. Much has been done, that is beyond
all praise, in insuring the best breeds of cattle.
While we hear pronounced with gratitude, the
names of Mease, Powell, Brantz, Clay, Gowen,
and Kelley, let us not forget that the task is not
finished.</p>

<p>Third. Soiling, it is apprehended, has been too
much neglected by most American husbandmen.</p>

<p>Fourth. Irrigation has also been too little attended
to in the United States.</p>

<p>Fifth. Proper care and precaution have not
been sufficiently bestowed upon the selection of
seeds. This is a subject of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>Sixth. Much is yet to be learned in regard to
the preservation and economical use of manure.</p>

<p>Seventh. The introduction, more generally, of
labor-saving machinery, and particularly of the
itinerant thrashing-machine, deserves to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Eighth. Gardening and raising fruit are much
neglected by our farmers.</p>

<p>It is respectfully suggested that special committees
might, with advantage, be raised upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
these and other useful topics, to report at the next
annual meeting.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania contains nearly thirty millions of
acres. According to the census of 1840, she had
a population of one million seven hundred and odd
thousands, which is nineteen acres and a fraction
for each inhabitant. In 1842, she raised, of grains
of all kinds, upward of sixty millions of bushels;
of potatoes, nearly thirteen millions of bushels;
of hay, upward of two millions and a quarter of
tons; of flax and hemp, upward of three thousand
three hundred tons; of tobacco, four hundred and
eighty thousand tons; of silk, upward of twenty-one
thousand pounds; of sugar, nearly three millions
and a half of pounds; and of wines, nearly
eighteen thousand gallons.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The Henrico Society</span> held its third annual show
at Richmond, Virginia, November 1st. The proceedings
are published in the Richmond Enquirer.
The Executive Committee reports, that although
there is a falling off in its receipts, there is an increased
interest and attention to its proceedings by
the planters. Mr. C. T. Botts, Editor of the
Southern Planter, made the address, from which
we subjoin an extract.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This society was organized and has been chiefly
supported by a few public-spirited gentlemen in
the neighborhood. Its beneficial effects are felt
and seen by all of you. To form a proper appreciation
of them, you have only to ride in any direction
about the suburbs of the city. Rude
grounds have been converted into productive gardens,
and barren wastes into smiling fields. I
recollect a lady's saying to me last summer, that
she meant to make her husband become a member
of this society, because it had done so much to
beautify the rides and walks about the city. She
declared the time had been when it gave her a fit
of the horrors, (she was a nervous lady,) to order
her carriage for an evening drive; but that now,
there was nothing that she and her children enjoyed
so much. But this is not all. Let him who
has been familiar with your market for the last
eight or ten years, compare its present abundant
supplies of the finest fruits and vegetables, with
the meager exhibition of former days; and, after
all, let us be as sentimental as we will, a good
market plays a very important part in the comedy
of human happiness. Our merchants and mechanics
too should remember, that these exhibitions
are annually becoming more and more attractive,
and that they are by no means inefficient in increasing
the trade of the city. But, over and
above all considerations of dollars and cents, let us,
one and all, come forward and enrol our names as
members of this association, which represents the
great agricultural interest of the state, and which
should be the pride and ornament of its metropolis.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Lake County Society.</span>&mdash;The show of this society
took place at Medina, Ohio, and a complete
account of its proceedings may be found in the
Painsville Telegraph. In addition to the usual
show of stock, &amp;c., an extensive procession was
got up of wagons and carriages, preceded by bands
of music. One of these held no less than 35 ladies,
engaged in the laudable occupations of knitting,
sewing, spinning, and various other domestic employments.
We wish we could chronicle more
such industrial displays, for we consider them an
excellent feature in agricultural shows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bourbon County Society of Kentucky.</span>&mdash;We
learn from the Paris Citizen, that the Eighth Annual
show of this Society took place near Paris,
and continued three days, and is said to be the
largest and most varied ever held in Kentucky.
The first two days were devoted to the exhibition
of domestic animals, agricultural products, and
farming implements; the third day, to that of domestic
manufactures. The show of horses present
was considered very superior; they were of
all varieties, from the mettlesome thorough-bred,
to the enormous cart-horse. The Durhams and
other horned stock were well represented, and
gave evidence in their splendid proportions of the
superiority of Kentucky pastures. The descendants
are said to be an improvement over the original
importations from England. Mr. Clay was present,
and had a superb pair of blankets presented
him by Mrs. James Hutchcraft. These were
made from the wool of Leicester sheep, and were
of uncommon size and thickness, weighing 23 lbs.
the pair. On the presentation of these blankets,
Mr. Clay was addressed by the Hon. Garrett Davis,
M. C., and he replied in his usual elegant and
happy manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hampshire, Hampden, and Franklin Society,
Massachusetts.</span>&mdash;The united show for the three
wealthy and populous counties above, came off at
the beautiful town of Northampton, on the 18th
and 19th October, and we much regret on more
accounts than one, that we could not, be present.
The Boston Cultivator furnishes a full report. A
large number of working-oxen of course were
present, and to these were added some superb fat
oxen, exhibited by Mr. Sumner Chapin. The
committee who reported upon this subject, attributes
the superiority of the cattle to the large infusion
of Short-Horn blood in their veins, and hence
their fine symmetry, light offal, and increased
weight of flesh on the more valuable parts, as compared
with native stock when fattened for the
shambles. Mr. Paoli Lathrop exhibited some
choice Short-Horns. Of native cows the committee
thus speak:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of the ten cows entered for the premium as
<i>native</i> animals, nearly or all have an intermixture
of Short-Horn or other foreign blood. We awarded
to Mr. Minor Hitchcock the first premium in
this class. In his written statement to us it appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>that her average product in milk for the six
months, ending 1st October, was 49 lbs. per day,
and in the months of June and July, 58 lbs. per
day. In butter, her average product in the same
time was more than 11 lbs. per week, and in the
month of July alone, nearly 14 lbs. per week; yet
in the same time he used the necessary milk and
cream for his family of four persons. Your committee
have entire confidence in the statement of
Mr. Hitchcock; yet it is proper here to remark,
that from his account of her, and though awarded,
a premium as a native animal, she partakes highly
of the blood of the Short-Horns. In the two
classes of animals entered as of <i>native and foreign
origin</i> it is obvious that a proper discrimination
was not made; for in some of the former there is
evidently more of the blood of distinct imported
races than the latter. Yet your committee deemed
it their duty to award the premiums of the society
to the two classes as they found them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now here it is, most everywhere that our native
cows are found excelling as milkers, we can trace
a portion of their blood, (usually the greatest
share,) to the Durhams, and yet there are those
who are constantly decrying the Short-Horns for
not being <i>milkers</i>. Verily a few particular people
are very hard to be convinced. It is our intention
hereafter to make up a table of the milking qualities
of the Short-Horns and their grades, and any
one possessing information upon this subject, we
shall be glad by their communicating the same to
us. Mr. Paoli Lathrop of South Hadley took the
first premiums on Durham bulls and heifers. Mr.
Ira Fenton of Belchertown on Durham cows. Mr.
Sumner Chapin of Springfield, the first premiums
on Fat Cattle and Working-Oxen.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Nathaniel Hart, Jr., of Kentucky, has just passed through
this city on his way home, having in company
with him three Rambouillet Merino bucks, purchased
of Mr. D. C. Collins of Hartford, Connecticut.
Mr. Hart has kept a large flock of the old-fashioned
Merinos for some time, on his plantation
at Versailles, Woodford county, and has purchased
these fine bucks, as the best animals which
could be found, for the purpose of making improvements
upon them. Kentucky will have in these
Rambouillets a valuable addition to her sheep
stock, and we recommend their produce in advance,
to the breeders of the western country. We understand
Mr. Collins has recently met with a great
demand for his sheep, and that he has now disposed
of all he has to spare this year. We congratulate
him upon it, and take some credit to
ourselves, for calling public attention to his very
valuable imported flock.</p>

<h2><a name="MAKING_CAPONS" id="MAKING_CAPONS"></a>MAKING CAPONS.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following article on making capons, is the
best within our recollection. It is taken from the
directions accompanying the sets of instruments
for caponising, made by Mr. John Mendenhall,
Philadelphia:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Fowls</span> intended to be cut, must be kept at least
twenty-four hours without food, otherwise the entrails
will fill the cavity of the belly and render it
almost impossible to complete the operation; besides,
when they have been starved the proper
length of time, they are less liable to bleed.</p>

<p>The chicken is taken at any age, from five days
old until it begins to crow, or even after. Lay the
fowl on its left side on the floor, draw the wings
back, and keep it firm by resting the right foot on
its legs, and the other foot or knee on its wings.
(The table with the apparatus does away with
the necessity of this stooping position.) Be careful
that the head of the fowl is not held down, or even
touched during the operation, as it would be sure
to cause it to bleed. Pluck the feathers off from
its right side near the hip joint, in a line between
that and the shoulder joint; the space uncovered
should be a little more than an inch square. Make
an incision between the two last ribs, having first
drawn the skin of the part backward, so that when
left to itself it will cover the wound in the flesh.
In some fowls the thigh is so far forward that it
covers the two last ribs; in which case, care must
be taken to draw the flesh of the thigh well back,
so as not to cut through it, or else it would lame
the fowl, and perhaps cause its death in a few
days after the operation, by inflaming.</p>

<p>The ribs are to be kept open by the hooks&mdash;the
opening must be enlarged each way by the knife,
if necessary, until the testicles, which are attached
to the back bone, are entirely exposed to view,
together with the intestines in contact with them.
The testicles are enclosed in a thin skin, connecting
them with the back and sides&mdash;this must be
laid hold of with the pliers, and then torn away
with the pointed instrument; doing it first on the
upper testicle, then on the lower. (The lower
testicle will generally be found a little behind the
other&mdash;that is, a little nearer the rump.) Next introduce
the loop; (which is made of a horse-hair or
a fibre of cocoa-nut;) it must be put round the testicle
which is uppermost, in doing which the spoon
is serviceable to raise up the testicle and push the
loop under it, so that it shall be brought to act upon
the part which holds the testicle to the back;
then tear it off by pushing the tube toward the
rump of the fowl, at the same time drawing the
loop. Then scoop it and the blood out with the
spoon, and perform the same operation on the
other testicle. Take away the hooks, draw the
skin over and close the wound; stick the feathers
that you pulled off before on the wound, and let
the bird go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks</span>.&mdash;If the operation be performed without
sufficient skill, many of the fowls will prove
not to be capons; these may be killed for use as
soon as the head begins to grow large and get red,
and they begin to chase the hens. The real capon
will make itself known by the head remaining
small, and the comb small and withered; the
feathers of the neck or mane will also get longer,
and the tail will be handsomer and longer: they
should be kept to the age of fifteen or eighteen
months, which will bring them in the spring and
summer, when poultry is scarce and brings a high
price. Take care, however, not to kill them near
moulting time, as all poultry then is very inferior.
The operation fails, principally, by bursting the
testicle, so that the skin which encloses the soft
matter, remains in the bird, and the testicle grows
again.</p>

<p>Birds of five or six months are less liable to
have the testicles burst in the operation than
younger fowls, but they are also more apt to bleed
to death than those of from two to four months old.</p>

<p>A skilful operator will always choose fowls of
from two to three months;&mdash;he will prefer also,
to take off the lower testicle first, as then the blood
will not prevent him from proceeding with the
other; whereas, when the upper one is taken off
the first, if there should be any bleeding, he has
to wait before he can take off the lower testicle.</p>

<p>The large vein that supplies the entrails with
blood passes in the neighborhood of the testicles;
there is danger that a young beginner may pierce
it with the pointed instrument in taking off the
skin of the lower testicle, in which case the chicken
would die instantly, for all the blood in its body
would issue out. There are one or two smaller
veins which must be avoided, which is very easy,
as they are not difficult to see. If properly managed,
no blood ever appears until a testicle is taken
off: so that should any appear before that,
the operator will know that he has done something
wrong.</p>

<p>If a chicken die, it is during the operation by
bleeding; (of course it is as proper for use as if bled
to death by having its throat cut;) they very seldom
die after, unless they have received some internal
injury, or the flesh of the thigh has been
cut through, from not being drawn back from off
the last two ribs, where the incision is made; all
of which are apt to be the case with young practitioners.</p>

<p>If the testicles be found to be large, the bamboo
tube should be used, and it should have a strong
cocoa-nut string in it,&mdash;for small ones the silver
tube with a horse-hair in it, is best.</p>

<p>When a chicken has been cut, it is necessary
before letting it run, to put a permanent mark upon
it; otherwise it would be impossible to distinguish
it from others not cut. I have been accustomed
to cut off the outside or the inside toe of the
left foot,&mdash;by this means I can distinguish them
at a distance. Another mode is to cut off the
comb, then shave off the spurs close to the leg, and
stick them upon the bleeding head, where they
will grow and become ornamental in the shape of
a pair of horns. This last mode is perhaps the
best, but it is not so simple and ready as the first.
Which ever mode is adopted, the fowl should be
marked before performing the operation, because
the loss of blood occasioned by cutting off the
comb or a toe, makes the fowl less likely to bleed
internally during the operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very common, soon after the operation, for
the chicken to get wind in the side, when the
wound is healing, between the flesh and the skin;
it must be relieved by making a small incision in
the skin, which will let the wind escape.</p>

<p>Those fowls make the finest capons which are
hatched early in the spring; they can be cut before
the hot weather comes, which is a great advantage.</p>

<p>Never attempt to cut a full-grown cock; it is a
useless and cruel piece of curiosity. I have never
known one to live.</p>

<p>Be not discouraged with the first difficulties;
with practice they will disappear; every season
you will find yourself more expert, until the cutting
of a dozen fowls before breakfast will be a
small matter.</p>

<p>It may be well to give a warning against becoming
dissatisfied with the tools. A raw hand,
when he meets with difficulties, is apt to think the
tools are in fault, and sets about to improve them
and invent others; but it is only himself that lacks
skill, which practice alone can give. I have spent
money, besides wasting my time in this foolish notion,
but have always found that the old, original
tools, which came from China, and where this
mode of operating was invented, are the best.</p>

<p>Take care that the tools are not abused by ignorant
persons attempting to use them; they will
last a person's life-time if properly used; but if
put out of order, none but a surgical instrument
maker can repair them properly.</p>

<p>The object in giving publicity to this, is to have
the markets of Philadelphia well supplied with
capons: they have ever been esteemed one of the
greatest delicacies, preserving the flavor and tenderness
of the chicken, with the juicy maturity of
age. In the Paris and London markets, double
the price of common poultry is obtained for capons.</p>

<p>Considering the abundance and excellence of
poultry in the United States, it seems surprising
that the art of making capons should be almost
entirely unknown&mdash;it is hoped that this deficiency
will now be supplied.</p></blockquote>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="GRAFTING_AND_BUDDING" id="GRAFTING_AND_BUDDING"></a>GRAFTING AND BUDDING.</h2></div>


<p>For what follows on grafting and budding, we
are indebted to that excellent family paper, the
New World. The article was prepared for it by
J. S. Skinner, Esq., of the Post Office Department,
Washington, from an English work, which, he
adds, "is not published or much known in this
country."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grafting</span>.&mdash;The process of grafting consists in
taking off a shoot from one tree, and inserting it
into another, in such a manner as that both may
unite closely, and become one tree; the shoot or
cutting thus employed is called a <i>scion</i>, and the
tree on which it is inserted or grafted, a stock.
The process of budding has precisely the same object
in view as that of grafting, differing from the
latter process only in the insertion of a bud, instead
of a shoot or cutting, into the bark of another
tree. To execute either process with adroitness
and success, considerable practice is required. To
excel in either, instructions should be received from
some competent person, who is both willing and
able to impart the necessary information. More
knowledge can be acquired in a short time in this
manner than can possibly be attained by the most
attentive perusal of any treatise expressly written
upon the subject. Impressed with the difficulty
of the task, many writers have indeed asserted,
that description alone must ever fail to convey an
adequate knowledge of the process; but the intelligent
author of the English Gardener has, with
his usual ability, treated the subject in so clear
and comprehensive a manner that we are induced
to give the details of the process in the author's
own language.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the subject of grafting and
budding, there is one thing which is equally applicable
to both processes, and that is, that the <i>stock</i>
ought to stand the whole summer upon the spot
where it is grafted, before that operation is performed
upon it. If stocks be planted out in the
fall, the sap does not rise vigorously enough in the
spring to afford a fair chance to the growing of the
graft; another remark of equal importance is, that
fruit-trees stand only <i>one summer</i> on the spot
whence they are to be removed to their final destination;
because, if they stand longer than this,
they will have large and long roots, great amputation
must take place, and the trees suffer exceedingly.</p>

<p><i>The Time of Grafting</i> is generally from the beginning
of February to the end of March,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> beginning
with the earliest sorts of trees, as plums,
cherries, and pears; and ending with the latest,
as apples. But seasons are different, and in a
backward season, the season for grafting will be
backward; and in such case, the fulness and
bursting appearance of the buds of the stocks, and
the mildness of the weather must be our guides.
However, it is certain that the mild weather, with
occasional showers, is the best time for grafting.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In this climate, April and May are the best months.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.
Am. Ag.</span></p></div>

<p><i>The Mode of Preparing the Scion</i> comes next.
Take from the tree from which you mean to propagate,
as many branches of last year's wood as will
cut into the quantity of scions that you want; but
in choosing what branches to take, let the vigor
of the tree guide you, in some measure. If it be
a healthy, flourishing, and young tree, take your
branches from the outside shoots, for the upright
ones at the top, or those near the middle, are more
likely to produce wood than fruit. Yet do not
take branches from the very lowest part of the
tree, if you can avoid it, as these are sure to be
more puling in their nature. In case the tree be
old or weakly, then choose the most vigorous of
its last year's shoots, no matter where they grow.
Keep these branches uncut until you arrive at the
season for grafting, keeping them, in the meanwhile,
buried in dry mould; and when that season
arrives, take them up and cut them into the
proper lengths for grafting. The middle part of
each branch will generally be found to be the best;
but your branches may be scarce and few in number,
and then make use of every part. Each scion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
should have from three to six eyes on it, but six
will, in all cases, be quite enough, as there is no
use in an extraordinary length of scion; but, on
the contrary, it may be productive of much mischief,
by overloading the head with young shoots
and leaves as summer advances, and thereby making
it more subject to accident from high winds
or heavy rains.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Grafting</i> is performed many
ways, though none of them differs from any of the
others in the <i>main principle</i>, which is that of bringing
the under or inner bark of the scion to bear upon
the same bark of the stock. The sap of the stock
flows upward toward the scion, and it will flow
on into the scion, provided it find no interruption.
Here, therefore, is the nicety&mdash;to fit those two
barks so closely, the one upon the other, that the
sap shall proceed onward into the scion, just as it
would have done into the amputated branch, causing
the scion to supplant the branch. I shall only
mention and illustrate two modes of grafting, viz.,
<i>tongue-grafting</i> and <i>cleft-grafting</i>. These two
it is necessary for me to speak of separately, and
thoroughly to describe, for they are not both of
them applicable in all cases; the former being
used in grafting on small-sized stocks and small
branches of trees, and the latter on large stocks
and large branches.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Tongue-Grafting.</span>&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 58.)</p>
<img src="images/fig2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Tongue-Grafting.</i>&mdash;Suppose you have your
stock of the proper age for grafting, you cut it off
at three or four inches from the ground, and with
a very <i>sharp, straight, and narrow-bladed grafting-knife</i>,
cut a thin strip of bark and wood upward,
from about two inches below your already
shortened stock. Make this cut at one pull of the
knife, inserting the edge rather horizontally, and
when it has gone through the bark and into the
wood a little short of the middle, pull straight upward,
(2, <i>a, b</i>;) then at rather less than half way
down this cut, and with the blade of your knife
across the cut, and downward, cut a very <i>thin
tongue</i> of not more than three eighths of an inch
long, (2, <i>c</i>.) Proceed nearly in the same way
with the bottom part of the scion; cut first a narrow
strip of wood and bark out, but not putting
the knife in horizontally, as you have done with
regard to the stock, (at 2, <i>a</i>,) nor bringing it out
straight to the end, to make a shoulder or angle,
as you have done at (2, <i>a b</i>;) but make a sloping
cut (1, <i>a b</i>,) of about the same length as the cut in
the stock, or rather a little less if anything; then
make a tongue (1, <i>c</i>) to correspond with that of
the stock, but recollect that this must be cut <i>upward</i>
instead of <i>downward</i>; then place the scion
upon the stock, inserting the tongue of the scion
into the tongue of the stock. Bring the four
edges of bark, that is, the two edges of the cut in
the top of the stock, and the two corresponding
edges of the cut in the bottom of the scion, to
meet precisely; or, if the scion be, in diameter,
a smaller piece of wood than the stock, so that its
two edges of bark can not both meet those of the
stock, then let only one meet, but be sure that one
meets precisely. But observe, that this can never
be unless the first cut in the stock and that in the
scion (2, <i>a b</i>,) and (1, <i>a b</i>,) be as even as a die, and
performed with a knife scarcely less sharp than a
razor. Take a common pruning-knife, and attempt
to make a cut of this kind, and you will find when
you come to fit the scion on, that, squeeze them
together as you may, you will, in most cases,
see light between the parts of the stock and
the scion that you are trying to join, so effectually,
as that the sap shall flow out of the one into the
other, unconscious of any division at all! But I
will not suppose anybody so ungain (as
it is called in Hampshire) as to go about
so nice an operation as this without being
prepared with the proper instruments
for performing it; and therefore, I now
suppose the scion put on properly, and
presenting the appearance as in (3, <i>a</i>.) But
this is not all; the operation is not yet
complete. The two parts thus joined
must be bound closely to one another
with matting, or bass, as the gardeners
call it, (4.) A single piece tied on to
the stock, will, if well done, almost insure
the junction; but lest parching
winds should come and rip up all vegetation,
it is usual to put on besides the
bandage of matting, a ball of well-beaten
clay sprinkled over with a little wood-ashes
or the fine siftings of cinders, to
cover completely the parts grafted, that is, from
an inch below them to an inch or so above them,
(5;) and, even to prevent this ball of clay from being
washed off by heavy rains, it is well to tie
around it a covering of coarse canvass, or else to
earth up the whole plant as you do beans or peas,
drawing a little mound around it so as to reach
nearly the top of the clay. Mr. Harrison prepares
his grafting clay in the following manner: Take
two parts of clay and one of horse-dung, free from
straw, mix them together, and beat the mass until
the whole is thoroughly incorporated, then temper
it with a little water till it is reduced to the
consistence of stiff paste. This composition <i>never
cracks</i> on drying!</p>

<p><i>Future Treatment.</i>&mdash;Something now remains
to be said on the future treatment of the grafted
plant. In a month's time at least, you will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
whether the scion has taken; it will then be either
bursting forth into leaf or be irrecoverably dead.
In this latter case, take off immediately the canvass,
clay, bandage, and dead scion, and let the
stock push forth what shoots it pleases, and recover
itself. In the former case, however, you must, as
soon as the scion is putting forth shoots, cut off,
or rub off, all shoots proceeding from the stock
between the ground and the clay, as these, if suffered
to push on, would divert the sap away from
the scion, and probably starve it; then carefully
stake the plant, that is, put a small stick into the
ground at within three inches, or thereabouts, of
the root, and long enough to reach a few inches
above the scion, which you will tie to it slightly
with a piece of wetted matting. This is really
necessary, for when the shoots proceeding from
the scion become half a foot long, they, with the
aid of their leaves, become so heavy as, when
blown to and fro by the wind, to break off immediately
above the clay, or become loosened down
at the part joined to the stock. The staking being
done, you need do nothing more till near the end
of June, when you should take off the whole mass
of canvass, clay, and bandage, but be careful in
taking off the clay not to break off the plant at the
junction. It should be done by a careful hand, and
after a day or two of rainy weather, as then the
clay is moist and comes off without so much danger
to the plant as when it is not. On taking off
the clay, there is found a little sharp angle, left at
the top of the stock; this should now be cut
smooth off. The bark of the stock and that of the
scion will heal over this, and the union is then complete.
Lastly, it is frequently found that mould,
and sometimes small vermin, have collected around
the heretofore covered parts of the plant, according
as the clay has been cracked by the sun. Rub
off all mould with your fingers, (no instrument
does it so well,) and kill all vermin in the same
way; and it is not amiss to finish this work by
washing the joined parts with a little soap and
water, using a small paint-brush for the operation.
All these things done, you have only to guard
against high winds, which, if the plant be not
staked, as is above described, will very likely be
broken off by them; and, in this work of destruction,
you will have the mortification of seeing the
finest of your plants go first.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<p class="caption center"><span class="smcap">Cleft-Grafting.</span>&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 59.)</p>
<img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><i>Cleft-Grafting.</i>&mdash;This is a species of grafting
adopted in cases where the stock is large, or where
it consists of a branch or branches of a tree headed
down. In either of these cases, saw off horizontally,
the part you wish to graft, and smooth the
wound over with a carpenter's plane, or a sharp,
long-blade knife, (1.)</p>

<p>Prepare your scion in this manner: At about,
an inch and a half from the bottom, cut it in the
form of the blade of a razor; that is, make it
sharp on one side, and let it be blunt at the back,
where you will also take care to leave the bark
whole, (2, <i>a</i>.) Having thus prepared the scion,
make a split (1) in the crown of the saw-cut
downward for about two inches, taking care that
the two sides of this be perfectly even. Hold it
then open, by means of a chisel or a wedge, (or
when the stock is but a small one, your knife,) and
insert the scion, the sharp edge going inward, and
the bark side or razor-back remaining outward, so
that, on taking out the wedge or chisel, the cleft
closes firmly on the scion, (3,) the two edges of
bark formed by the cleft, squeezing exactly upon
the two edges of bark formed by the blunt razor-back.
To make the two barks meet precisely is
the only nicety in this operation; but this is so
essential, that the slightest deviation will defeat
the purpose. In this sort of grafting, the stock on
which you graft is generally strong enough to hold
the scion close enough within its cleft, without
the aid of binding, and then it is better not to bind;
but as it is also necessary to prevent air circulating
within the wounded parts both of the stock and
the scion, use grafting-clay to cover them over so
as to effectually exclude the air; and cover the
clay with a piece of coarse canvass, wetting it
first, and then binding it on securely. In this way,
the stock being strong, you may insert several
scions on the same head, by making several different
clefts, and putting one scion in each; but this
can only be to insure your having two to succeed,
for if all the scions that you put on one head take,
you must choose the two most eligible, and sacrifice
the rest, as more than two leading limbs from
such head ought not to be encouraged. The season
for performing this sort of grafting, and the
mode of preparing the scion, and the future treatment
of the tree, are precisely the same as in
<i>tongue-grafting</i>.</p>

<p><i>Crown, or Bark-Grafting</i> is a very ready method
of grafting upon large, uneven, old stocks and
branches. It is practised somewhat later than
the methods above described, that is, from the
end of March to the third week in April, because,
in that period, the separation of the bark from the
wood is more easily affected; a circumstance of
primary importance in this case. The tree is to
be headed down, the cut being made horizontally,
and the section bored quite even and smooth;
then make a slit in the bark two inches in length,
next with the handle of a budding-knife, carefully
open the bark for about a quarter of an inch; then
cut the scion about two inches in a sloping direction,
in the form of a tongue, leaving the bark entire
on the outside. The scion thus prepared, is
pressed downward between the bark and the wood
as far as the incision in the stock extends; the
bark of the stock readily yields to the pressure
employed, and the scion is supported in its situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>tion
by a few coils of bass-matting, the whole being
surrounded by clay.</p>

<p><i>Dove-Tail Grafting.</i>&mdash;This is a very neat and
successful mode of grafting, originating with Mr.
Malone, who gives the following directions for its
performance. The scion is to be selected so as to
have two or three buds above where the knife is
to be inserted to prepare it for the operation; a
slip is cut off the end of the scion, sloping it to the
bottom as long as it may be decided to insert it
into the stock. On each side of the cut, as far as
it extends, a part of the bark is to be taken off,
leaving the under part broader than the upper, on
which upper or back part always contrive to leave
a bud. The stock or branch to be worked is thus
prepared: Being first cut off smooth and straight,
two parallel slits, distant from each other nearly
the width of the scion and the length of its cut part,
are then made in the bark of the branch, observing
particularly to slope the knife, so that the under
edge of the cut next the wood may be wider than
the outer edge. The piece of bark between the
slits must then be taken out, separating at the bottom
by a horizontal cut. The scion will then slide
into the dove-tail groove thus formed, and, if the
work is well performed, will fit neatly and tightly.
A small quantity of the grafting-clay must then
be carefully applied, securing it on with list, or
any other convenient bandage, fastening it at the
end with two small nails. The top of the stock
should be entirely covered with clay, sloping it
well up to the grafts, and should be examined often
to see if any cracks or openings appear, which
should be immediately filled up with some very
soft clay. The proper time for performing the
operation is from the beginning of April till the
middle of May, or earlier if the sap is in motion.

<img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Budding.</span>&mdash;Budding is performed for precisely
the same purpose as grafting, and, like grafting,
it is performed in many different ways; and as
long experience has ascertained the best method,
namely, that of T budding, (1,) so called from the
form of the two cuts that are made in the bark of
the stock to receive the bud, or <i>shield-budding</i>, as
it is sometimes called from the form of the piece
of bark (2) on which the bud is seated, assuming
the shape of a shield when it is prepared to be inserted
within the T cut in the stock.</p>

<p>The only solid difference between budding and
grafting is this, that whereas in grafting you insert
on the stock a <i>branch</i> already produced, in
budding, you insert only the <i>bud</i>. I shall proceed,
in treating of this matter, in the same way that I
did in the preceding article, namely, <i>as to the season
proper for budding, the choosing and preparing
of the bud, the operation of budding, and the
future treatment of the plant budded</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Season for Budding</i> is generally from the
latter end of July to the latter end of August, the
criterions being a plump appearance of the buds
formed on the spring shoot of the same year, seated
in the angle of a leaf, and a readiness in the
bark of the stock to separate from the wood.</p>

<p><i>In Choosing and Preparing the Bud</i>, fix on one
seated at about the middle of a healthy shoot of
the mid-summer growth&mdash;these are, generally
speaking, the most inclined to fruitfulness. Choose
a cloudy day, if you have a choice of days at this
season, and if not, perform your work early in the
morning, or in the evening. The time being
proper, you sever the branch on which you find
the buds to your liking. Take this with you to
the stock that you are going to bud, holding the
branch in your left hand, the largest end downward;
make a sloping cut from about an inch and
a half below the bud to about an inch above it,
suffering your knife to go through the bark, and
about half way into the wood, cutting out wood
and all. This keeping of the wood prevents the
bud and its bark from drying while you are preparing
the incision in the stock, and if you wish
to carry buds of scarce sorts to any distance, you
may do so safely by putting their ends in water,
or in damp moss, but it is always safer, as well in
grafting as in budding, to perform the operation
with as much expedition as possible, but particularly
it is so in budding.</p>

<p><i>Operation of Budding.</i>&mdash;Cut off the leaf under
which the bud is situated, but leave its foot-stalk,
(2, <i>a</i>,) and by this hold it between your lips,
while with your budding-knife you cut two
straight lines in the stock at the place where
you wish to insert the bud, and this should
be where the bark is smooth, free from any
bruises or knots, and on the side rather from
the mid-day suns. Of these lines let the first
be horizontal, (1,) and let the next be longitudinal,
beginning at the middle of the first
cut and coming downward. Let them, in
short, describe the two principal bars of the
Roman letter T. You have now to take out
from the bark on which the bud is, the piece
of wood on which the bark is, and which has
served you, up to this time, to preserve the
bud and bark from drying and shrinking. But
this is a nice matter. In doing it you must be
careful not to endanger the root of the bud, as it
is called, because in that is its existence. The
bark, (if the season be proper for budding,) will
easily detach itself from this piece of wood, but
still it requires a very careful handling to get it
out without endangering the root of the bud. Hold
the bud on your fore-finger, and keep your thumb
on the wood opposite; then with the fore-finger
and thumb of the other hand, bend backward and
forward the lower end of the shield, and thus coax
the wood to disengage itself from the bark; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
when you find it decidedly doing so, remove your
thumb from it, and the whole piece of wood will
come out, leaving you nothing but a piece of bark
of about two and a half inches long, with a bud
and foot-stalk of a leaf on it. If the root of the
bud be carried away with the piece of wood, you
will perceive a small cavity where it ought to be.
In this case, throw away the bud and try another.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in the second attempt, now
open the two sides of the longitudinal bar of the
T with the ivory haft of your budding-knife, but
in doing this, raise the bark clearly down to the
wood, for the inside of the piece of bark belonging
to the bud must be placed directly against this.
Having opened these sides wide enough to receive
the longest end of the bark, insert it nicely, taking
especial care that its inner side be flatly against
the wood of the stock. Then cut the upper end
of the bark off, so that its edge shall meet precisely
the edge of the horizontal bar of the T (3, <i>a</i>.).
With your finger and thumb bring the two sides
of the longitudinal bar over the bark of the bud,
or rather the shield, and with a piece of well-soaked
matting, begin an inch below this bar and
bind firmly all the way up to an inch above the
horizontal bar, taking good care to leave the bud
peeping out. Bind in such a way as to exclude
the air, for that is the intent of binding in this
case. Tie your piece of matting on first, and wind
it round and round the stock as you would a riband,
taking care not to twist the matting; wind it
slowly, and every time you have gone completely
round, give a gentle pull to make it firm.</p>

<p><i>Future Treatment.</i>&mdash;In a fortnight's time from
the operation, you will discover whether the bud
has taken, by its roundness and healthy look; and,
in a fortnight after that, loosen the bandage to allow
the plant to swell, and in about five weeks
from the time of budding, take away the bandage
altogether. In this state, the plant passes the
winter, and just as the sap begins to be in motion
in the following spring, you head down the stock
at about an inch above the bud, beginning behind
it, and making a sloping cut upward to end above
its point. Some gardeners leave a piece of the
stock about six inches long for the first year, in
order to tie the first summer's shoot to it to prevent
its being broken off by the wind. This may
be well when the plant is exposed to high winds,
but even then, if you see danger, you may tie a
short stick on the top part of the stock, and to this
tie the young shoot, and then the sap all goes into
the shoot from the bud, instead of being divided
between it and six inches of stock left in the other
way. There are some advantages which budding
has over grafting, and these I think it right to mention.
In the first place, universal experience has
proved that certain trees succeed much better
when budded, than the same trees do when grafted,
such are the peach, nectarine, apricot, plum,
and cherry; indeed, the rule is, that all stone-fruits
do better budded than grafted, that they are, when
budded, less given to gum, a disease peculiar to
stone-fruits, and often very pernicious to them.
You may also, by budding, put two more branches
upon a stock that would be too weak to take so
many grafts, and you may bud in July when
grafting has failed in March and April. The disadvantage
of budding is that the trees are rendered
one year later in coming into bearing than when
you graft.</p>

<p>Mr. Knight has recommended a mode of budding,
(Hort. Trans., vol. I.). He thus describes the
process: In the month of June, as the luxuriant
shoots of my peach-trees were grown sufficiently
firm to permit the operation, I inserted buds of
other varieties into them, employing two distinct
ligatures to bind the buds in their places.
One ligature was first placed above the bud inserted,
and upon the transverse section through
the bark; the other which had no further office
than that of securing the bud, was applied in the
usual way. As soon as the buds had attached
themselves, the ligatures last applied were taken
off, but the others were suffered to remain. The
passage of the sap upward, was in consequence
much obstructed, and the inserted bud began to
vegetate strongly in July, and when these had afforded
shoots about four inches long, the remaining
ligatures were taken off to admit the excess
of sap to pass on, and the young shoots were nailed
to the wall, being there properly exposed to
light, their wood ripened well, and afforded blossoms
in the succeeding spring.</p>

<p><a name="HIGH_CRANBERRY" id="HIGH_CRANBERRY"></a>We should be pleased if any of our readers could
give us further information about the shrub described
below.</p></div>

<i>From the Yankee Blade.</i>
</p>


<h2>HIGH CRANBERRY.</h2>


<p>A gentleman of this place having occasion some
twenty years ago, to make an excursion into the
northern part of the state, near Lake Umbagog,
where the Magalloway empties into the Androscoggin,
passed through a large piece of low land,
comprising many acres, which was covered with
the high cranberry as far as the eye could see, exhibiting
the most beautiful and splendid appearance,
perhaps, ever displayed from any of the
spontaneous productions of the forests of New
England. He says that some shrubs which had
acquired the magnitude of trees of several inches
diameter, were literally bent to the ground, under
the weight of their luxuriant fruit; and such was
their abundance, that a single individual might
have gathered more than thirty bushels in a day.</p>

<p>The high cranberry in dense forests, sometimes
acquires the respectable altitude of 15 or 20 feet;
but in more open places, its height is generally
from 6 to 8 or 10 feet. Its stem and leaf very
much resemble those of the snow-ball; and the
flower, while it lasts, is but little inferior in elegance
and beauty to the flower of that highly ornamented
and much esteemed shrub. The fruit
is smaller than that of the running cranberry, of a
bright red color when ripe, and grows in large,
flat clusters on the ends of the branches. Its taste
is very acid, and rather austere. It contains a
large, hard, flat seed, which is an objection to the
use of it without sifting or straining; but being
sifted or strained after stewing, it is excellent for
sauce, pies, and tarts. Prepared with sugar, in
the usual way, it makes a most delicious jelly.</p>

<h2>FINE WOOL SHEEP.</h2>

<p class="r">
<i>Buskirk's Bridge, October, 1843.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> read the article headed "Sheep, Paular
Merinos," over the signature of Examiner, in the
May number, page 52 of your paper, purporting
to give us plain farmers an insight into sheep
breeding, &amp;c.; and what fine flocks used to be,
when the "old fashioned Merino sheep" were in
their "glory." What they were a quarter of a
century ago, I cannot say, that was before I had
any thing to do with sheep in this country; but
I presume that <i>fine</i> flocks were then not so numerous
as they are now. I can not agree with
the writer, "that the fine flocks of the United
States are sadly deteriorated, indeed, nearly run
out." Since 1825, I have been acquainted with
fine sheep in this country, and I venture to say,
that there are three, four, or five, and in this section,
<i>ten</i>, fine flocks, where there was but one 18 years
ago.</p>

<p>If Examiner will honor me with a visit, an invitation
I herewith cordially tender to him, I will
show him <i>fine</i> flocks, consisting of more than a
few individuals&mdash;a dozen or two, or may be a few
scores, of picked sheep together, and kept in the
very highest possible condition; no, but flocks
from 500 to 1,000&mdash;even more&mdash;which might alter
his judgment, if that is not swayed by prejudice.
Many of these large flocks shear on an average 3
lbs. and over, of wool, well washed on the sheep's
back, the quality of which is superior to the
"Paular," and "old-fashioned Merinos;" and I
doubt not, should Examiner make a comparison
between the two kinds himself, he would pronounce
it <i>superfine</i>; and besides the quality, he
would also discover a great difference in the condition
and cleanliness of the wool. These flocks
are high-grade Saxons, and show a result not
quite so "unfortunate" as Examiner would make
us believe. My own flock of 240 ewes and lambs
and a few bucks, pure, unmixed Saxons, whose
pedigree can be traced back to the importations
of the Elector of Saxony, from the royal flocks of
Spain, sheared this year 2 lbs. 13 oz. per head;
last year 2 lbs. 14 oz. clean wool. If I had had a
proportionate number of weathers among them,
the average would have been at <i>least</i> 3 lbs. I repeat
then, that the wool of the "Paular," or "old
fashioned Merinos," does not compare with the
Saxons and their crosses in quality and condition.
If the fleeces from the former are heavier than
from the latter, let it be borne in mind that they contain
more <i>gum</i>, and <i>yolk</i>, dirt, &amp;c.,; are not so fine,
and that the sheep <i>consume a greater quantity of
feed</i>. These are facts well known to every good
judge of wool, and to every experienced, practical
shepherd.</p>

<p>I would ask whether Examiner had his eyes
closed against them when he was examining the
fine-wooled flocks of the United States, and declared
them "sadly deteriorated, indeed, nearly
run out." I do not pretend, Mr. Editor, that I am
acquainted with all "the fine flocks of the United
States, but allow me to say, that my acquaintance
among the wool-growers is pretty extensive. I
am a purchaser, as well as a grower of wool, and
handle no inconsiderable quantities yearly. My
purchases this year amount to over 130,000 lbs.,
and I have examined at least 300,000 lbs., and a
great variety of flocks of different grades and character,
have come under my observation&mdash;sheep
kept in the very lowest up to the very highest condition.
I have always found, that where the blood
of the "old fashioned Merinos, Paulars," or whatever
their possessors are pleased to call them, predominated,
there also I found <i>gum</i>, yolk, dirt, and
other substances adhering to the wool, in great
abundance, <i>unfit to make cloth</i> of, which goes far
to make up the greater weight of fleece over the
Saxony. Indeed, sir, when gentlemen talk of fine
fleeces weighing 8, 9, or 10 lbs. they forget to
mention "<i>including gum, yolk, dirt, and other
substances adhering to the fleece</i>."</p>

<p>Some years since, I saw a lot of "old fashioned
Merino" wool at a factory in Massachusetts, which
the manufacturer assured me would lose 55 per
cent. in cleansing. "Indeed," said he, "we can
never estimate the dirt in such wool correctly; it
always exceeds our estimate, and we invariably
suffer loss." And recently, a gentleman, a dealer
in wool, told me that he sent this season, a large
quantity to Boston to be sold, and that on making
sale of some 36,000 lbs., the manufacturer who
bought it, rejected all gummy, dirty fleeces, declaring
that he would not have them, as such wool
would lose more than 50 per cent. in cleansing.
And to use the gentleman's own words, "there it
lies, in a corner of the wool room, and I do not
know what to do with it;" observing at the same
time, that the manufacturers were "getting more
cunning." There was a time when the supply
fell short of the demand, and almost any wool,
however gummy and dirty, found ready purchasers;
for manufacturers were often compelled to
buy it, in order to keep their machinery in operation;
but that time has gone by, and they are now
more choice in their selections, and when they
come across a lot of such wool they pass it by,
with observations like these: "I do not want it, it
is too dirty, let him keep it for some body else"!</p>

<p>In your July number, page 130 and 131, Mr.
Editor, you have made a calculation of the number
of sheep, and the quantity of wool obtained therefrom.
The census of 1840 shows, say 20,000,000
in the United States. Of this number you estimate
only 11,000,000 shorn sheep, yielding 24,500,000
lbs. of wool, and the lambs at 9,000,000.&mdash;With
due deference to your superior opportunities
for information, I beg leave to say that you
are over estimating the number of lambs, for every
practical wool-grower knows, that that proportion
is too large&mdash;if you had said one third, you would
have come nearer the truth. I think you are mistaken
also that the census of 1840 included lambs,
it was exclusive of lambs.(<i>a</i>) You are, however,
perfectly safe in estimating the average weight of
fleece in the United States at 2¼ lbs. This is certainly
too low by one fourth of a pound.(<i>b</i>) In
this region it exceeds 2¾ lbs. Then you say, that
by producing a superior quality of wool, its value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
would be increased nine cents per pound; this certainly
is attainable; but the way in which you
propose to bring it about, namely, by crossing with
the "Paular, or old-fashioned Merinos," you would
not obtain that end, thousands of fine flocks would
be reduced in quality.(<i>c</i>) In this section it would
reduce the quality as much as you wish to improve
it. Coarse sheep would be improved by the cross;
but to apply it to all the sheep in the United
States, as I understand you to say, you would find
yourself very much mistaken in the result. I venture
to say, that on the same quantity of feed, you
can not increase the heft of fleece of a fine flock
shearing from 2¾ to 3 lbs., by your cross up to 3¾
to 4 lbs. per head, and have the wool in equally
good condition.(<i>d</i>) An increase of feed will do
much toward increasing the heft of fleece. A
few words more and I have done.</p>

<p>Examiner, page 52, says: "As to Paular Bucks,
it strikes me that you might, for any practical purpose,
just as well have advised a cross of the fabulous
Unicorn, for it would be just as easy to find
the one as the other at the present time in the
United States; for depend upon it, there is no such
thing now existing, as <i>a Paular Buck</i>, nor <i>any thing
deserving the name</i> in the whole country." And
you say that "there are still large and valuable
flocks scattered over the country."(<i>e</i>)</p>

<p class="r">
<span class="smcap">H. D. Grove.</span>
</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Immediately upon the receipt of this letter
of Mr. Grove's we wrote on to Washington to ascertain
the facts in the case, but were answered
that the census bureau was abolished, and they
could not tell. We know that when the person
for taking the census in the district in which we
were then residing, called upon us, he required the
number of colts, calves, lambs, and pigs, although
some of them were only three days old at the
time; and to our objection of rendering an account
of such young stock, he remarked, "never mind,
they will be grown when the census appears, and
it is the law." Most of those to whom we have
put the question about rendering an account of the
lambs in their flocks, say they did so; others do
not recollect. If there has been irregularity with
sheep-owners in giving an account of their lambs,
of course we are incorrect; and we think, upon reflection,
we may have estimated the number of
lambs too high; though, on the other hand, we are
quite certain Mr. Grove has set them down as entirely
too few; for we know flocks that produce
within a fraction as many lambs annually as there
are breeding ewes.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Perhaps when Mr. Grove has travelled south
and west more extensively, and seen in the months
of March and April, as many half-bare sheep as
we have, which shed their wool from disease,
want of care, &amp;c., he may come to a different conclusion.
We have often seen flocks in the same
condition at the north too, leaving many of our
farmers little to boast of in this respect.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) We have turned to the article to which Mr.
Grove alludes, but really, we do not find that we
used the expressions attributed to us. We said
"Spanish Merino," also, "unadulterated Merino;"
meaning thereby, the Rambouillets more particularly.
We also spoke in general terms, in recommending
the use of these. Such a flock of Saxons
as Mr. Grove's we would <i>especially except</i>; and
if the accounts which we hear of them be correct,
and we have no doubt they are, we would not
cross them with anything less fine than themselves.
They are unquestionably superior animals,
as is proved by their superior weights of fleece,
and the high price the wool commands; and we
wish, since the name of Saxon has been so basely
misused in this country by miserable counterfeits,
that Mr. Grove would give his flock the name of
Electoral; for they and their descendants are probably
the only ones entitled to it in the United
States. With this name, they would then fairly
stand aloof from the common herd, as they deserve,
and not be associated in idea hereafter, with the
miserable riff-raff of the country, passing under
the general name of Saxons. It is our intention
next season to call and see Mr. Grove's flock.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) We meant to be understood as alluding to
a cross on the coarser and more restiff sheep of
the country, when we spoke of obtaining an increase
of weight of wool on the same food, and
we know that this can be done.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) True enough, but we did not say these valuable
flocks were Paulars; nor did we go so far as
to assert that they were pure Merinos of any distinct
name. We wish it understood, that we do
not endorse all the opinions of Examiner any more
than we do other correspondents&mdash;he speaks for
himself, and we for ourselves.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Can</span> you inform me whether the sea-mud which
is found on the shore, below high-water mark, is
of any value to the farmer; and if it is, in what
way would you advise that it should be applied?
Do you think that it would answer in a compost
heap, or would it be preferable to put it into the cattle-yard
or hog-pen? I have thought that the only
objection to using it would be on account of the
great quantity of salt, which it contains; although
Leibig and other celebrated writers, speak in very
favorable terms upon the application of salt. And
here arises another question. Are not those farms
which are situated upon the sea-shore sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
supplied with salt by the winds which are constantly
sweeping over them? Johnson remarks
that this is the case, and if this is so, would not
the application of this sea-mud be too strong? although
I am inclined to believe that by drying the
mud, much of the virtue of the salt would necessarily
be destroyed, and as sea-water contains, as
Leibig states, many very fertilizing qualities, this
mud which perhaps has been accumulating for
ages, must have imbibed a large quantity of all
those properties, of which sea-water is composed.

<h2>FARM OF HUGH MAXWELL, Esq.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Good Effects of Marl.</span>&mdash;In a conversation
with Hugh Maxwell, Esq., some short time since,
he stated some facts in relation to the fertilising
power of a red marl abundantly existing at Nyack,
which induced me to visit the spot. I found Mr.
Maxwell's farm of 110 acres bounded by the Hudson,
well worth a visit. The whole was in excellent
fence, made of the loose stones found on
the land, neatly piled about 4½ feet high, forming
fields of from 4 to 8 acres. The formation of these
fences has used nearly all the stones which were
on the surface of the lands. And in this it would
seem as if Divine Providence had caused the rocks
to be distributed of the proper size for fencing.
Had the pieces been much larger or smaller they
would not have answered the purpose so well as
they now do. If they had been planted two feet
under ground, or had been piled in larger masses,
the labor of fencing would have been very greatly
increased.</p>

<p>This farm, as well as all those about Nyack,
lies on the singular mass of sandstone included by
a front of about five miles on the river. All the
surrounding rocks are of other materials. This
sandstone, when quarried, exhibits strata of a kind
of red marl of many feet in thickness, lying between
strata of the sandstone. The quarry-men
throw it out of their way, and millions of loads
are lying near the water's edge, so that in many
places vessels can lie alongside a bed of it, and
slide it on board. On Mr. Maxwell's farm, the
former proprietor, desirous of making extensive
hard walks through his garden, caused this marl
to be put upon them about one foot deep. Soon
after this was finished, the walks began to produce
clover; the white in such profusion and persevering
succession, that all prospect of using the paths in
that condition was abandoned: they could not be
kept in order by the hoe. Mr. Maxwell being
strongly impressed by this occurrence, determined
on applying it to the surface of his farm. I saw
a field of corn of several acres which had been
top-dressed this year with the red marl, now
bearing not less than 80 bushels of shelled corn to
the acre&mdash;as great a product as is obtained from
the best city manure, costing at Nyack nearly 37
cents per load. I saw an upland field of wheat,
on which, as an experiment, Mr. Maxwell had
top-dressed with this marl a space of three rods
by two, from which I pulled an average bunch of
straw-stubble, that is more than double the size
and weight of any like parcel of stubble, to be
found in the whole field of several acres. Unfortunately
the husbandman had cradled all the
wheat indiscriminately, which prevented Mr.
Maxwell from examining the separate product of
the wheat. I should not hesitate to pronounce it
a double product. Mr. M. top-dressed a field of
oats with this marl, and the yield was 70 bushels
per acre. He top-dressed a field of clover with it
the third year from the seeding, and the product
is heavier than the crop of the <i>second year</i>. This
field was dressed with ten loads of marl per
acre. The corn is large 12-row yellow, and the
stalks are about 10 feet high. The corn-blades
never curled during the late drought, while other
fields all curled. The corn was worked with
the hand-harrow once, with the cultivator twice,
and was hoed twice. No plowing between the
hills. Mr. M. thinks that in dry weather it is
very injurious to run the plow through, for it cuts
the smaller roots of the corn. He has tried
25 bushels of hickory ashes, against 25 of anthracite
coal ashes, and found no perceptible difference
in the result.</p>

<p>The general effect of this red marl is perceptible
in almost every plant and tree in that vicinity.
Fruit-trees are especially vigorous and free from
disease. Flowering shrubs, roses particularly,
seem not to have been touched by any insect. I
pulled up a mullein stalk growing on a naked
mound of this marl, which measures nine feet in
height, and the flower stem, which is covered with
buds, is four feet in extent. The trees, excepting
peach alone, are more thriving than those I have
anywhere seen. The peach-trees have the yellows.
Moss roses growing in rich grass are remarkably
strong; Mr. M. finds that they do better
closely surrounded by grass than in clear ground.
He has ten kinds of healthy cherry-trees, including
the red and white ox-heart, and the bull's eye.
He has freely given, and wishes to distribute buds
and grafts to all those who ask for them. Mr. M.
has very healthy apricots, which have yielded fine
fruit. <i>He smoked the blossoms with sulphur and
pitch</i>, and all the fruit was perfect. <i>This smoking
was done in the evening.</i></p>

<p>Some of the fields had never been but partially
cultivated, on account of being so swamped
that cattle mired in them. He made in one four-acre
field a drain ten rods long, and three feet
deep, filled in with coarse stone. This drain formed
a <i>perpetual spring for his cattle</i>, and this barren
field has now buckwheat of at least <i>thirty
bushels per acre</i>. <i>One and a half bushels</i> of seed
was sowed per acre. No manure needed. This
drain cost $1.75. Twelve acres were drained in
the same style at a cost of $150; this field is now
fine, and asks for no manure from New York, or
Nyack marl. He prefers the same amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
marl to best New York city manure for all grains
and grapes.</p>

<p>Mr. M. has the old English yew thriving in
open air in winter. The European mountain ash,
white and red linden, red maple, weeping ash,
weeping beech, weeping elm, Madeira nut, (one
five years old bearing fruit,) Spanish chestnut now
in fruit, (this tree has also some blossoms on it at
this time.) Apricots grafted on plum stock are
very thrifty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Remarkable Horse.</span>&mdash;In passing through Mr.
Maxwell's barn-yard, I noticed a couple of horses,
one of which was hoppled with a strong iron chain.
What mischievous young horse have you there?
He replied, it is my old family mare Kate, who
has carried me, and my wife and children, safely
for the last one and twenty years! I bought her
when she was about four years old, but she will
break fences now (wooden ones) with her irons
on, she is so active and cunning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Locust Eggs.</span>&mdash;I remarked at Nyack the work
of the locust, and Mr. M. and Thomas Addis Emmet,
Esq., examined with a good microscope, a
twig worked by the little insect. The twig being
split in the line of the work, exhibited the whole
process of the egg deposite. The twig is pierced
nearly to its centre at every three quarters of an
inch, or nearly so; the wood is rendered fibrous,
it is then lifted up, and the eggs, which are of a
long, oval form, are deposited side by side at an
angle of about 45 degrees to the grain of the twig,
and the fibrous tuft of wood placed over them,
with its end sticking out; these incisions being
repeated every inch on a line for some few inches
in each twig. With the microscope, we saw the
eyes of the young locusts always heads to the
centre. The general outline of the young animal
was perceptible through its delicate membranous
cover. They moved slightly on being disturbed.
Almost every twig so operated on by the locust
was entirely dead. The magnifying power of the
microscope was perhaps 40 or 50.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Value of an Orchard.</span>&mdash;I visited an apple
orchard at Nyack, which arrested my attention by
its regular and healthy appearance. I found young
Van Houton at home, who, with perfect good
feeling and true politeness, gave me the account
of the orchard which I desired. When his father
was about fifty years of age, he undertook to plant
150 winter pippin-trees on that spot. His neighbors
thought him an old fool to plant twigs of
apple at his time of day. Young Van Houton,
then about 16 years of age, held the little nurslings
in the holes while his father filled in the soil.
The old gentleman continued to prune them, so
that they are widely branched and open for air
and sun within the mass of branches. For twenty
or twenty-two years past, the old gentleman has
often received $1,000 a year for his apples.
Sometimes $6 per barrel; sometimes sold in the
orchard for $1 per barrel. That old gentleman
and his wife are now, between them, 174 years
old. Let no man be afraid to plant winter pippins
because he is fifty or sixty years of age.</p>

<p>I have been highly pleased with my excursion.
When gentlemen of high rank in learned professions
are found turning that intellectual force
which has influenced the most wealthy and intelligent
portion of mankind, from law, politics, &amp;c.,
to that greatest, best of all arts&mdash;agriculture, I
look for good results and I find them. The old
world is hard at work in this direction, and I hope
that we shall watch her operations with the eye
of our own bird, and see to it, that we be not excelled
in any good thing.</p>

<h2>MEDITERRANEAN WHEAT.</h2>

<p class="r">

</p>


<p>I have noticed your remarks in the October No.
of your paper, on the Mediterranean wheat. Your
views coincided with mine when I first sowed this
variety of wheat; but I have sown it now for two
seasons, and the change has been so great in the
color, as to convince me that by cultivating it here,
it will lose its dark color, and become as good in
that respect, and yield as much flour as any wheat
we have. The two seasons I have raised it, it
has been the best wheat I had. I have doubts
whether it will tiller as much as some other varieties,
and therefore sow it much thicker.</p>

<h2>TOPPING COTTON&mdash;MARL.</h2>

<p class="r">
<i>Sumpter District, S. C., Nov. 4th, 1843.</i>
</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> those excellent matter-of-fact articles on the
cultivation of cotton, which have appeared in the
late numbers of your paper, by Dr. Philips of
Miss., and which, by the way, are the best I have
ever seen on the subject, I do not recollect that he
has touched upon the subject of topping cotton.
I have made one experiment in this, and was
pleased with the result. Some planters north of
us, I understand, have also tried this method, and
find the cotton is not so apt to shed, as when it is
not topped, especially in wet seasons. Ordinarily
we reckon the first week in August the best time
for topping; but this, of course, will depend upon
the season, and the forwardness of the crop&mdash;for
sometimes it must be earlier, and sometimes later.</p>

<p>I tried the effects of what I suppose to be marl,
on a small spot in one of my fields, say about one
acre. The marl I judge to be of poor quality, yet
can not say, positively, as I have no analysis of it.
I dug it out in January last, and spread it broad-cast,
at the rate of 30 loads to the acre, as large
as an ordinary pair of mules would carry. It seemed
to pulverize well, exposed to the severe frost
of last winter, and I plowed it in deeper than I
usually plow, and harrowed the land well. The
result is, I shall get full one third if not one half
more cotton off of this piece than any other part of
the field, which more than pays me for the trouble.</p>

<p>I need not say that we read the articles on manures
in the Agriculturist with much interest; for
many of us are beginning to learn that it is not only
easier and better, but even <i>cheaper</i> to renovate our
old lands, than emigrate to a new country and
bring new lands into cultivation.</p>

<h2>HINTS ON THE CULTIVATION OF WHEAT.</h2>

<p class="r">
<i>Buffalo, October 25th, 1843.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are four conditions that modify the value
of a wheat crop. One may not only be larger in
measure than another, but heavier for the same
measure; yielding more flour from a given weight;
and lastly, affording a greater proportion of gluten
from the same quantity of flour. It is necessary
for the farmer to have each of these considerations
in view, if he would attain the utmost success in
the cultivation of this invaluable grain. My object,
in this brief article, will be, to afford some
helps to the agriculturist in increasing the ultimate
value of his crop. As a starting point, it will,
perhaps, be most instructive to inquire, what are
the constituent elements of wheat?</p>

<p>Sprengel has analyzed both grain and straw,
and the following is the result:&mdash;1000 lbs. of
wheat afford 11·77 lbs. and of wheat straw, 35·18
lbs. of ash, consisting of</p>

<p>This analysis shows an amount of ash far below
the average. Davy found 15·5 lbs. of ash in 100
lbs. of ripe wheat straw; and Johnstone, in one
variety, grown on a soil abounding in limestone,
16·5 per cent. of ash.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen, according to the above
analysis of Sprengel, that of the total of grain, less
than 1½ per cent., and of straw, rather more
than 3½ per cent. is earthy or inorganic matter;
while all the remainder is composed of the organic
materials, carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen,
of which carbon alone constitutes about one
half. All these constituents are absolutely essential
to the perfection of the crop. In the natural
condition of a fertile soil when first reclaimed,
these materials are usually found in sufficient abundance
to produce wheat. Such was the condition of
nearly all the land in New England, and the eastern
portion of our own state; but a few years of
careless, unscientific cropping, has exhausted one
or more of those constituents which may have
existed in an available form; and much of it, after
a very few of the first years of its cultivation, has
been of little or no value for wheat, under the
system of tillage there adopted. It has been asserted
by Dr. Dana, that in a soil purely granitic
(and much of the land in that region partakes of
this character), there is potash enough for successive
crops of wheat for 3,000 years, and lime
enough to last more than twice that period. But
the result is the same for the growing vegetation,
whether the materials do not exist at all, or are
locked up beyond the reach of it. It is absolutely
certain, if wheat will not grow with care and industry,
and all the usual appliances of good husbandry,
where it once nourished successfully,
there is one or more ingredients wanted, in such
a condition, that the plants can appropriate them
to their own nourishment. And first of the inorganic
matters.</p>

<p>The proportion of straw will vary from 2 to 3½
times the weight of the grain. Suppose the quantity
taken off the land be estimated at 2½ times
the weight of the grain. In a series of crops
averaging 20 bushels of wheat per acre, for 30
years, we shall have as the result 36,000 lbs. of
grain, and 90,000 lbs. of straw carried off the soil,
charged with all the materials above enumerated,
and probably sufficient to reduce the land to a very
small capacity for production.</p>

<p>Some limited portions of the earth, as the plains
of Babylon, when under skilful cultivation, the
valleys of the Indus and the Nile, and the fields of
Sicily, almost since the days of the flood, have
produced luxuriantly, without the aid of manure
to any extent; but it must be remembered the
former have their fertility annually renewed by
the rich overflowings of the rivers, which are
charged with all the materials necessary to restore
exhausted nature; while the soil of the last, being
wholly of basaltic origin, is rich in the alkalies,
which a year or two of rest, is sufficient to replenish
in a soluble state, to be again taken up by the luxuriant
crop. Hence, we have witnessed a drainage of
nearly all the products from these fertile regions,
for thousands of years, with impunity. But they
are exceptions which only go to prove the general
rule. The farmer must look to it, that all the ingredients
that enter into his crops, are supplied by
the materials in his soil, or a deficiency, or entire
failure, will be the inevitable result.</p>

<p>Although all the constituents entering into the
straw and grain, are absolutely essential to their
perfection, they are not all equally essential to be
contained in the soil. It is indispensable, however,
that the earthy or inorganic portion of them be
there, for these can not be obtained elsewhere.
How shall they be best supplied? Ashes, it is
believed, afford the cheapest, as well as one of the
most effectual applications that can be made for
grain. Of the ten fixed ingredients enumerated as
entering into wheat, ashes yield potash, soda, lime,
magnesia, sulphuric and phosphoric acids, in large
proportions, and silica and iron in smaller. The
chemical operation of the potash, and carbonate
and sulphate of lime, however, when added to the
soil, is to supply the silica, in a soluble state, from
its natural condition, (it being found in abundance
for this object in every soil, except in such as are
formed almost exclusively of peat,) for the demands
of the crop.</p>

<p>An increased supply of lime and gypsum, beyond
what is found in the ashes, is frequently
advantageous; and when the latter is beneficial,
as it generally is, it should never be withheld
to an extent in the highest degree useful.
Of the operation of this last material, beyond yielding
a portion of its sulphur to the gluten, we have
as yet no satisfactory explanation. In respect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
the theory of its concentrating ammonia in the soil
from the atmosphere, we have very contradictory
authority. Liebig asserts it, Johnstone questions
it, and Dana denies it; yet the increasing
fertility its application produces, would seem to
give the weight of experience in favor of Liebig's
views.</p>

<p>The chlorine and soda, if not furnished by the
ashes in proportions sufficiently large, may be procured
by the application of common salt, which
yields both. The phosphoric acid may be obtained
in any required quantity, by the addition of bones,
which, dry or calcined, yield both that acid and
lime, phosphate of lime constituting 86 per cent.
of bones. Most soils contain alumina in abundance
to furnish the food requisite for wheat; yet as it is
one of the most valuable soils for this grain, both
as seizing upon and retaining ammonia, and furnishing
a firm foothold for the roots of the plants,
it is important that lands intended for this purpose,
should be adequately supplied with alumina as a
top-dressing, if naturally deficient in it.</p>

<p>We have, then, above, all the inorganic materials
for the purpose required. But there is about
97 per cent. of the crop yet to be made up of the
organic constituents, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and
hydrogen. How shall they be provided for?</p>

<p>First, by the selection of a calcareous or clay soil,
which will furnish a proper bed for the roots of
the plant, and by their peculiar mechanical texture
and chemical composition, will not only hold the
manures incorporated with them, but also draw
some of the requisite constituents largely from the
air; the former absorbing carbonic acid, and the
latter ammonia.</p>

<p>Second, by the liberal application of common
farm-yard manure, to a crop preceding that of
wheat, which will leave a rich mould highly conducive
to an abundant yield of perfect grain. An
instance has been recently given, of a Maryland
farmer raising large successive crops of wheat, by
the application of putrescent manure directly upon
the grain, and all injurious effects were obviated
by the use of a moderate quantity of lime. This
is a practice, however, which has not been found
generally to be successful, causing either blight,
or such rapid and luxuriant growth, as to crinkle
and lodge. This effect is also produced in peaty
and rich alluvial soils, where the silicate of potash,
so essential to the formation of a strong, upright
stalk, is not furnished in a quantity large
enough for the object.</p>

<p>Third, the liberal use of charcoal scattered
through the soil. It is claimed from its use, that
the wheat crop of France has been largely augmented
within the few past years. Several instances
of its greatly beneficial effects, have been
noticed in this country; though its influence has not
hitherto been felt on wheat, by an extensive Virginia
planter, in two or three recent experiments. The
great power of condensing gases peculiar to charcoal,
was noticed by some of the early chemists.
Murray mentions it, and Saussure gives a table of
results, in which he shows that perfectly dry charcoal
from boxwood, will absorb 90 volumes of
ammonia; 85 of muriatic acid; 65 of sulphurous
acid; 55 of sulphuretted hydrogen; 35 of carbonic
acid, &amp;c. This condensation takes place in its
pores, and does not produce any alteration, or new
chemical compounds of the gases thus stored up;
but their use in an agricultural point of view, is
invaluable; for while the coal yields no fertilizing
matter from its own substance, being nearly indestructible,
it takes from the atmosphere in great
abundance, and hoards up for the future use of the
plants, one of the most evanescent, as well as most
useful materials for their perfection, viz., the nitrogen
contained in the ammonia.</p>

<p>A fourth means for procuring a good yield of
wheat, is by alternating with clover, and turning
in a liberal share of it as a preparation for the
wheat. This is practised extensively throughout
the wheat districts of the United States, and has
resulted in great benefit; for besides yielding a
portion of food to the grain, it keeps the ground in
the best possible mechanical condition.</p>

<p>A fifth means, is to return all the straw and
chaff to the soil, as they contain a large quantity
of the identical materials required for a succeeding
crop.</p>

<p>With the foregoing causes in full action, and
an adequate supply of moisture, whether from
rains, dews, or artificial irrigation, the crop will
draw largely from the atmosphere for the supply
of its required organic constituents. Carbon will
be furnished from its carbonic acid; nitrogen from
its ammonia; hydrogen from its vapor, dews, and
ammonia; and oxygen from air, water, and soil.</p>

<p>The use of all these materials, <i>together with the
selection of the best varieties of seed</i>, will give
the first three requisites of a wheat crop; large
measure, heavy weight, and much flour.</p>

<p>Manures peculiarly adapted to the object, will
tend in the highest degree to produce the greatest
quantity of <i>gluten</i>, the most valuable portion of
the flour. It is true, that climate has much to do
in condensing, and of course, improving the value
of wheat. It is a general principle, that the
warmer and drier the climate where it is grown,
the more valuable the grain. Wheat from the
south of Europe, is worth more than when grown
in the north; and that from any portion of the
United States, owing to our superior dryness of
climate, is more nutritive than what is produced
in Great Britain. This difference is increased from
8 to 14 per cent. in favor of the American. Gluten
varies in wheat from 8 to 35 per cent.; in rye, 9 to
13; barley, 3 to 6; and oats 2 to 5. The <i>quality</i> of
wheat with regard to the quantity of gluten it contains,
is nicely estimated and fully regarded by
accomplished bakers.</p>

<p>The nitrates of potash, or soda, are frequently
used in England to increase not only the quantity,
but especially the quality of their flour, a practice
the high prices of land and produce may render
profitable there, though it is hardly to be expected
they could generally be used in this country to a
profit. In an experiment lately tried in England,
one acre of wheat dressed with one cwt. of nitrate
of soda, gave 42½ bushels, weighing 60¾ lbs. per
bushel; another acre dressed with two cwt. yielded
47-3/8 bushels, weighing 60½ lbs.; while an undressed
acre, in every other respect similar to the
others, yielded only 27-7/8 bushels, weighing 61 lbs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Numerous other instances could be given equally
conclusive.</p>

<p>Although we may not be justified in using these
somewhat expensive salts, so highly charged with
nitrogen, there are sources of supply within our
reach, especially rich in this material, and abounding
in many of the other ingredients of fertility.
These are animal manures of all kinds, but more
particularly urine, human excrements, and the
offal of animals, such as uncalcined bones, horns,
hair, hides, flesh, blood, &amp;c. All of these contain
large proportions of nitrogen, and if carefully incorporated
into the soil, would tend largely to the
increased production and value of the wheat crops
throughout the country. An experiment was made
in manuring wheat with cow dung, which contains
the smallest proportion of nitrogen, and this
yielded 11·95 per cent. of gluten. Another parcel,
grown on land manured with human urine, gave
35·1 per cent. Thus it will be seen, that the
maximum of value in wheat, may be reached, by
the application of an article, almost everywhere
wasted in the United States.</p>

<p>It is by skilfully feeding the wheat plant with
all the nourishment that it can take up, that the
crops may be indefinitely increased. Lord Hardwicke
stated, in a speech before the Royal Ag. Soc.
of England, that the fine Suffolk wheat had
produced 76 bushels per acre; and another and
more improved variety had yielded the astonishing
quantity, of 82 bushels per acre. There is no
comparison between the capacity of an animal and
seeds, to produce results; for while the former is
limited to a definite growth, which no effort of
science or skill can augment, a seed may multiply
beyond almost any assignable limit. We have
been shown a stool of wheat, originating from a
single seed, the growth of the present season, with
30 stalks, averaging from 100 to 110 grains on each
head. Over 3,000 perfect grains, is thus the product
of a single parent in one season. It requires,
then, but the proper pabulum to produce good
wheat, within the wheat latitudes, in every portion
of the Union. Some of our worn-out eastern lands
may be so totally unsuited to its growth, as not to
justify the efforts of reclaiming or fitting them for
this object, especially, while we have a region in
the west, every way adapted by nature, to its most
successful cultivation. But we can not for a moment
doubt, that when those western fields become
comparatively full, industry and science will
combine to clothe again those hills and valleys
(now but partially robed with a scanty herbage),
with teeming crops of wheat, such as gave to
them, in their pristine days, a fame for fertility
seldom exceeded.</p>

<h2>A PENNSYLVANIA DAIRY.</h2>

<p class="r">
<i>Philadelphia, Nov. 6th, 1843.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Noticing</span> in your October number an account of
a dairy on Long Island, I am induced to give you
a description of one in this vicinity. Mr. Henry
Charley has a dairy farm near Laurel Hill, where
he keeps from 40 to 50 cows, consisting of Ayrshire,
Holderness, Alderny, Durham, and a few
natives; but mostly crossed with a fine, thorough-bred
Short-Horn bull, and is raising full bloods,
and high grades of this breed as fast as possible.
He makes veal of his bull-calves, and raises all
his best heifer-calves from his best cows for his
own use. I found the cows luxuriating in a rich
clover pasture when I visited them last summer
between 2 and 3 o'clock, the hour for afternoon
milking, from which they were taken by the
herdsman, and driven half a mile to the barn.
This is a stone building 100 feet long, 46 feet
wide, with a wing of 60 feet, the same width as
the barn, high walls, and steep roof, which make
it capable of holding a great quantity of fodder,
consisting last year mostly of cornstalks, (some of
which he bought very cheap of his neighbors,
while others let theirs stand in the field and this
spring raked them up and burned them,) rye
straw, and oats unthrashed, all of which he cuts
and steams&mdash;sometimes with a little hay cut also
and mixed with the above articles. These are all
steamed together, or each separately, (as best suits
the appetites of the cows) in a large vat, connected
with a pipe through which the steam passes
from the boiler, which stands in a room adjoining
with stone or ground floor. The chimney is of
sheet-iron running up through the roof, and coal
used for fuel, renders the risk for insurance
at a very low rate. The water is supplied
from a spring running into the yard, and thence
through a pipe into the boiler. The cows are also
watered from the same when the weather is
stormy in winter, and they are not allowed to go
out. But to return from this digression. After the
fodder is sufficiently cooked, which takes but a
short time, it is taken out into other larger vats or
troughs, with scoop shovels, and there left to cool;
then a suitable portion of Indian meal or ground
rye, buck-wheat, or oats, or any two or all four
mixed and ground together, (which in my opinion
would be better,) adding a portion of ship-stuffs,
shorts, or even bran. This is the food for the cows
at all seasons, except when there is a full supply
of grass. They are driven to a woods pasture for
exercise and air when there is little or no grass.
Air and exercise are indispensably necessary for
the health of cows, and without these, the milk
will always be more or less unhealthy, according
to the nature of their confinement.</p>

<p>When the cows were brought into the yard, I
was puzzled to know how they were to be handled;
but the stable doors being thrown open, each
cow entered the door nearest her stall, and went
to it with as much regularity as a young miss
goes to her seat in a boarding-school. There is a
drop in the floor immediately behind the cows, 14
inches wide and 4 inches deep; into this all the
excrements fall, the water running off immediately
to a reservoir prepared for the purpose of receiving
it; this, together with all the manure, was taken
away daily, and put upon the land or crops or in a
heap to make compost; so that the premises were
kept perfectly clean and sweet. The floor was
covered with a thin bed of cut straw, which was
passed off with the manure as it became soiled,
and by being cut, worked immediately into and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>corporated
itself with the manure, without vexing
the husbandman or gardener as long green manure
so frequently does. The floor behind the cows,
between the trough to catch the liquid and the wall,
is six feet wide, with strong plank platforms or tables
on which to set the vessels containing the
milk. There is an open space directly over the
vat for steaming, where all the feed is cut and
passed down through a hopper into the vat; also,
hoppers or spouts leading from the meal room
over head directly into the vats, which contain the
steamed feed for cooking. The mangers in which
the cows are fed are broad, so that the food may
be thrown into them with scoop shovels without
waste, of which I found nothing of the kind about
the whole premises. If a little too much feed is
given to one animal, and consequently left, it is
carefully scraped out and fed to one having a better
appetite; thus the mangers were kept clean
and sweet. Mr. Charley feeds roots, but to what
extent I did not learn. I hope he may be induced
to write you a letter, giving a description of his
cutting machine, which does its work better than
any one I have ever seen; having two blades
coming together like shears, cutting corn-stalks
through their joints with as much apparent ease
as a pair of tailor's shears would cut a thread.</p>

<p>There is a stable for dried cows which were
feeding for the butcher. Box stalls are provided
for cows about to calve; the young cattle are kept
by themselves, as are also the calves. Mr. Charley
was not at home when I visited his dairy; but
this disappointment to me was made up by the
kind Mrs. C., who, with justifiable pride, showed
me her spring house with its large copper caldron
for scalding her milk tubs, pans, pails, churns, &amp;c.
&amp;c., in the best of order, all of which she personally
superintends and looks after; and whenever
there is an overstock of milk for city customers, it
is here converted into butter of the choicest quality,
and each market-day finds her at her stand
with her butter and lots of garden vegetables, the
raising of which she also superintends and takes into
the city at the dawn of day. That some families
are sick and others miserably poor, is not strange, to
one who looks behind the curtain and sees what
can never otherwise be described.</p>

<h2>REPLY TO THE GARDENER'S CHRONICLE.</h2>

<p class="r">
<i>New-York, 14th November, 1843.</i>
</p>




<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Gardeners' Chronicle, published in England,
has the following criticism on my essay of
dock-mud, inserted in your April number of this
year, page 13:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We trust the editor is more correct in his
other statements than in this, concerning the percentage
of sea-salt in guano, which contains little
more than a trace of it."</p>

<p>I have never analysed the guano, but depended
on one or two analyses given by Professor Johnston,
reader of chemistry in the University of Durham,
England, in the appendix to his Lectures on Agricultural
Chemistry. He gives tables of contents
of two parcels, the first containing 30.3 per cent.,
the second rather more than 11 per cent. of sea-salt.
I took the larger quantity, to prove that if
dock-mud contained sea-salt, it could be no objection
to it as a fertilizer.</p>

<p>It is highly important that the tables of analysis
of celebrated manures should be correctly given,
and if the editor of the Chronicle can furnish correct
tables, he will be conferring an important boon
on the agricultural community of the whole world.</p>

</p></div>


<h2>SOUTHERN CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> closing month of the year is one in which every
agriculturist should take an interest, and for many
useful hints we will refer the reader to the Northern
Calendar for this month.</p>

<p>Cotton-picking will probably occupy this month until
Christmas, when this business will have been completed,
if the culture has been well managed, and the
season favorable. It would be well to start your
plows and break up ground for corn; let nothing but
cotton prevent&mdash;not even cleaning; for plowing is
only one job; yet, if done soon, it is generally advantageous,
and if bad weather should set in when it must
be done, time will be lost, and a drawback ensue,
whereas by plowing in time, cleaning can be done later.</p>

<p>In weather not employed about other labor more important,
manure and trim all kinds of vines and fruit-trees,
except the orange tribe. Transplant evergreens
and other trees, sweet briers, honeysuckles, jasmines,
&amp;c.; sow late peas and beans, and set out onions for
seed; set all hands at work in cleaning up for other
crops, picking up limbs, grubbing, cleaning up hollows,
sides of bayous, cutting down corn-stalks with hoes,
gathering materials for making manure, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>If you do not live in the immediate vicinity, say
five or six miles, from a sugar-plantation, by all means
keep bees. This can be rendered one of the most productive
branches of business of the day. Procure a
few swarms at first, and they will soon multiply to any
extent required. Use sections of hollow logs, four or
five feet long, for hives, if you have no other more
convenient materials to make them of, and allow the
bees to work over the honey a second time, that you
may avoid the injurious effects in eating honey which
may have been gathered from poisonous flowers. If
the above-named class of hives be used, there will be
no necessity for killing the bees; for when the hives
are filled with honey, they can be removed without
harm from the end opposite to that in which the bees
are at work, and they will immediately go to work and
fill the vacancy. In most parts of the Southern States
bees maybe kept at work during the winter. If there
are not flowers for them, they can be made to work
over the bad honey collected the season before.</p>

<p>This is also a busy month for the sugar-planter.
He will be active in cutting and carting his cane with
all possible despatch; and he should employ one or
more practical and intelligent men to conduct the operations
of the mill. In the manufacture of sugar, we
know of no better method than that given by Professor
Mapes in a letter to Hon. H. L. Ellsworth, from which
we make the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To cut the cane as ripe as possible, but before
any acetic acid is formed; litmus paper, touched to
the fresh-cut cane, will turn red if acid.</p>

<p>2. Express the juice without loss of time, as every
moment after cutting will deteriorate its quality.</p>

<p>3. A small quantity of clear lime-water, say one
quart to a hundred gallons of juice, should be added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
the moment it is expressed, unless the juice shows
acidity with litmus paper; in that case, no lime should
be used, but a solution of sal-soda or soda ash should
be added, until it is precisely neutral.</p>

<p>4. When the juice is neutral, free from excess of
acid or alkali, it should be evaporated in such an apparatus
as would finish its charge in 30 minutes; if
the boiling power is too small, good crystallization can
not possibly be obtained.</p>

<p>The whole time occupied, from the cutting of the
cane to finishing its boiling, should not exceed one
hour.</p>

<p>5. To know when the boiling is finished, place a
thermometer in the kettle, and continue to evaporate
until it stands at 239° Fahrenheit. If, when placed to
run off after cooling, it should be found too freely
boiled, the next time boil to 240°, or, if too light to run
off, to 238°, and so on.</p>

<p>6. The kettle or boiler should be so arranged, that
the moment it is done its charge should be thrown
into a cooler, capable of holding a number of charges.
The first charge should be left in the cooler with stirring,
until the second charge is thrown in; then with
an oar scrape the crystals found on the side and bottom
of the cooler loose, and gently stir the whole mass together:
the less stirred the better; so continue at the
letting in of each charge, to stir gently; and when all
is in the cooler, let the whole stand until it cools down
to 175°; then fill out into sugar-moulds of a capacity
not less than 14 gallons. When cooled in the mould
sufficiently, say fourteen hours, pull the plug out of
the bottom of the mould, and insert a sharp point,
nearly as large as the hole, some six inches; withdraw
the point, and stand the mould on a pot to drip.</p>

<p>7. If the sugar is intended to be brown, leaving it
standing on the pot for a sufficient length of time, in
a temperature of 80°, will run off its molasses, and
leave it in a merchantable shape; it will probably require
twenty days. It can then be thrown out of the
moulds, and will be fit for use. When moulds can
not be obtained, conical vessels of wood or metal, with
a hole at the apex, will answer equally well.</p>

<h2>NORTHERN CALENDAR FOR DECEMBER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Settle</span> all your accounts, collect what is due you,
and pay what you owe. "Short settlements make
long friends." Examine your farm statistics, and see
what have been the results of your experiments with
the different kinds of manures, seeds, modes of tillage,
&amp;c., &amp;c.; and note them well for future use. No
farmer ought to be without such a book, in which all
experiments should be carefully recorded at the time,
and the results carried into a separate book for his
own use hereafter; and if new and valuable discoveries
are obtained, communicate them to some agricultural
periodical for the benefit of the world. Recollect,
you have the experience of thousands to guide
your operations, and, by contributing to the general
stock whatever may be useful, you are but returning
to mankind a part of the benefits you have derived
from them. But avoid twaddle and humbuggery, and
oft-published statements, and prolix or tedious narration,
and give all the circumstances material to the
subjects in the briefest, plainest, simplest language
possible. Above all things, send in your subscription
to one or more valuable agricultural papers, and get
as many of your neighbors to subscribe as possible;
and consider, in so doing, you are benefiting yourself
by it ten times as much as you are the publishers.
Summer is peculiarly the time for making observations
and experiments, and winter the time for communicating
them. <i>Remember the poor</i>, not only in this month,
but every month through the year, and especially during
the inclemency of winter. You need not give so
much to them outright, but endeavor to put them in a
way of making themselves comfortable, by affording
them employment, by which, you may be benefited,
while doing them good. You thus confer on them a
triple benefit, by furnishing them the means of comfortable
subsistence, teaching them to help themselves,
and avoiding the habit of receiving <i>charity</i>, which insensibly
weakens their sense of self-dependance.</p>

<p>Stock now requires increased attention: they must
be well housed, or at least protected against wind,
with a shelter to which they can resort in storms, well
supplied with salt, and abundance of water, if possible,
in the yard, where they can get it when they
want, and without wearying themselves in looking for
it, and wasting their manure by dropping it in the
road, or by a running stream or pond, where it will all
be lost. Their feed should be regular, and given to
them as near stated times as possible. They look for
their food then at certain hours, and are not uneasy
and fretful till the customary period arrives, when
they again fill themselves, and rest quietly, digesting
their food till it is time to look for another supply. If
brought up in regular habits, brutes are much better
time-keepers than many are disposed to consider them
who have not observed closely their intelligence. Now
is a good time to break steers and colts, while the
roads are smooth and hard. They ought to be early
accustomed to handling and the halter, and be gently
treated, by which they are more disposed to yield to
the wishes of their master. If they have been always
used to good treatment, they will acquire a confidence
in their keepers, and the more readily submit to their
guidance. 'Tis always better to train them with
strong, well-broken animals. Sympathy has more to
do with the brute creation than they have credit for
generally; and the good habits and orderly behavior
of the older animals, they have been accustomed to
treat with deference, will not be without their wholesome
effect on them.</p>

<p>This is the best month for spreading out hemp for
dew-rotting, in the latitudes below 40°, as it gets a
whiter and better rot than if spread earlier.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitchen-Garden.</span>&mdash;Every fine day uncover the
frames in which are lettuce and cauliflower plants;
otherwise they will become spindling, from want of
air. Hot-beds can now be made, for forcing asparagus
for the table in January. If the ground is open, continue
trenching for spring crops. When the ground
is frozen, cart manure, repair fences, clean seeds, prepare
tools for spring. Provide pea-sticks, bean-poles,
&amp;c., and finish all that will be required in the spring,
and which can be done when the ground is frozen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fruit-Garden and Orchard.</span>&mdash;Finish those things
which may have been omitted the previous month. If
the weather continues open, digging and plowing may
be done advantageously. Perform any work that may
tend to forward your business in the spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flower-Garden and Pleasure-Grounds.</span>&mdash;Continue
to protect your beds of bulbs, and also flower-beds
and shrubs as directed in last month. Should the
weather continue open in the early part of this month,
bulbs may still be planted. They should not be left
as late as this, but if such has been the case, they had
better be planted now than left until spring. Now
carefully protect seedling bulbs. The more tender
kinds of trees can have their roots protected from
frost by laying manure or long litter about them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the steamship Caledonia, we are favored by the
receipt of our European journals up to the 4th November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Markets</span>.&mdash;<i>Ashes</i>, both pots and pearls, have advanced,
and were brisk of sale. <i>Cotton</i> had declined
1/8d. per lb. The recent advices from Bombay and
Calcutta of the East India crop, were not quite so favorable.
The stock of Cotton on hand at Liverpool on
the 1st November, was 720,000 bales, against 520,000
at same period last season. <i>Flour</i> was flat, and little
doing in it. <i>Naval Stores</i>, declining. <i>Provisions</i> were
about the same as by our last advices, with the exception
of Cheese, the finer qualities of which were of
quick sale. <i>Tobacco</i>, steady and firm.</p>

<p><i>Money</i> still plenty, and the low rates of interest prevail.</p>

<p><i>American Stocks</i> continue nearly the same as at our
last. Very few recent transactions.</p>

<p><i>Agricultural School.</i>&mdash;We see by the Berwick Warder,
that an Agricultural School is established in Aberdeenshire,
by the practical farmers of that county,
which promises to be a very useful institution. It is
superintended by Mr. R. O. Young, and we like its arrangements
better than anything of the kind we have
yet seen. To explain these, we make a few quotations
from the prospectus.</p>

<p>The young gentlemen who may be intrusted to Mr.
Young's charge for the purpose of being instructed in
the principles and practice of Scottish agriculture, will
have daily opportunities of witnessing the regular routine
of farming operations going on at the farm, and of
taking an active part in these operations.</p>

<p>They will be required to keep, in a farm-book, a
daily record of what has been done on the farm. Explanations
will be given of the principles upon which
the different operations are conducted, and upon which
they will be examined at stated times. Regular minutes
will be kept by the pupils of all such explanations,
as well as of any facts that may come to their knowledge
through their occasional intercourse with the
farmers of the country.</p>

<p>There will be stated times set apart for reading, as
text-books, the most approved agricultural works of
the day; and on the subjects of their reading Mr. Y.
will minutely examine the young gentlemen, and will
also require them to write exercises upon given agricultural
topics&mdash;particularly those that bear on practice.</p>

<p>While it will be Mr. Y.'s care to direct the attention
of the pupils to chemistry and geology in their application
to practical agriculture, a branch of study until
lately very little attended to, he will make arrangements
for procuring the services of the professor of agriculture
in the University of Aberdeen, for a few
weeks every summer, to give lectures and conduct experiments
on the analysis of soils, manures, &amp;c.&mdash;thus
securing to the pupils more than a mere theoretical
knowledge of this important branch of agricultural education.</p>

<p>As nothing is so much calculated to impress any
subject upon the youthful mind, as to invest it with a
<i>personal interest</i>, Mr. Y. proposes to devote to the
exclusive use of his pupils, a small farm, of about 50
acres in extent, adjoining to his other farm. This
small farm contains a variety of soils, upon which experiments
of different kinds may be conducted, on a
small scale. It will be possessed and managed by the
pupils, under Mr. Y.'s direction, and upon certain
equitable rules as to each pupil's share of the concern.
Each pupil will be required to keep regular books, exhibiting
all disbursements and receipts, and the results
of all experiments tried, with every particular connected
with such experiments. Each pupil will be required
to take his share of management, &amp;c., and the profits
of the concern, after paying a certain moderate rent,
will, at each term, be divided among the young gentlemen,
in proportion to their respective interests. It
is conceived that such a plan will have a strong tendency
to promote exactness, regularity, and business
habits; but, without the consent of their parents or
guardians, pupils will not be asked to join in this
scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmers' Magazine.</span>&mdash;<i>Meat-Salting Instrument.</i>&mdash;The
instrument resembles a common syringe of more
than ordinary dimensions, and, although not quite so
simple in its construction, it is intended to be used in
the same way as the syringe, provided the point or
tube be not exposed to the air. The advantages to be
derived from the use of the instrument are explained
by the fact that a joint of meat may, in the simplest
manner, be properly salted in less than ten minutes.
The brine is made of the usual ingredients, and after
the salt and other substances are completely dissolved,
the liquid is poured into the machine, and the nipple
or tube (the circumference of which is perforated with
three small holes) is inserted into the most solid part
of a joint of meat, and the contents are, by a very
strong pressure, forced through the fibres until the
brine is seen to escape on the surface. For this purpose
a smaller quantity of pickle is used than is employed
in the ordinary method of curing meat, and the
bone (if there be any,) in the centre becomes thoroughly
impregnated with the fluid. By the present mode of
salting meat, it is a matter of some difficulty to inject
the brine into the innermost part of a large joint,
whereas by the process which is adopted in the use of
Mr. Carson's instrument, the size or substance of the
meat presents no additional trouble to the operator.</p>

<p><i>Prince Albert's Annual Sale of Live Stock.</i>&mdash;Since
Prince Albert has turned farmer, he has an annual
sale of his fat stock, and is said to realize from 50 to
60 per cent. profit on it. The last took place in October,
at which time 417 sheep, 55 oxen, and 9 cows
and heifers, were disposed of, realising him £1,743,
(about $8,000;) a clever sum for fat sheep and cattle.</p>

<p><i>Produce of Ewes.</i>&mdash;Count de Gourcey states in that
part of his Agricultural Tour in Europe, just received,
that Mr. Walker, manager of the late Duke of Gordon's
estates, in Scotland, informed him that from 200
Leicester ewes, and as many Southdowns, they <i>bring
up on an average</i>, 450 lambs. We wish we had possessed
this information when writing our notes to Mr.
Grove's letter in this paper, as it would have been
something of an argument in our favor, regarding the
difference of opinion existing between us about the
number of lambs bred in the United States.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New Farmers' Journal.</span>&mdash;<i>Exportation of Cattle
to Prussia.</i>&mdash;One bull and eight heifers have been recently
purchased in England, for the Royal Agricultural
Society of Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Netting for Sheep-Folds.</span>&mdash;The fibre of the cocoa-nut
is said to make the most durable netting for
sheep-folds; it out-wearing several sets of tarred-hemp
netting, and is so light, that a herdsman can with ease
carry 200 yards of it.</p>

<p><i>Soiling.</i>&mdash;Feeding animals in the summer-season
with green food, cut daily, and given them in stalls or
yards, is far preferable to grazing&mdash;First, because
the food is consumed with less waste; secondly, because
rest is an equivalent for food. The bodies of
animals do not remain stationary, but are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
wasting in proportion to the amount of exercise they
undergo&mdash;hence, while they rove at large, they must
receive from time to time new supplies in the shape of
food, to make up for this waste, which are not needed
when they are at rest, and consequently, by the system
of soiling, less food will be required to fatten them.
Thirdly, because by soiling there is an increase of valuable
manure, which, by the old method of grazing,
was nearly altogether lost.</p>

<p><i>American Provisions.</i>&mdash;Within the last few days, 204
boxes of American cheese have been received in Liverpool.
Every year the quality of the American
cheese improves. Another article, which is arriving
in very large quantities, is American lard, which is
coming into use for many purposes for which salt and
even fresh butter has been employed. Very excellent
salted beef has come from the United States in considerable
quantities.</p>

<p><i>Epidemic among Cattle.</i>&mdash;This has broken out again
in a most virulent shape in the north of England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Journal of Agriculture.</span>&mdash;<i>Miller's Safety Reins.</i>&mdash;These
consist of gut covered with leather, and are,
therefore, proof against fracture; and being round,
and of neat light appearance, form a rather ornamental
and sporting-like appendage to harness or saddle.
They are mounted in this way:&mdash;They pass through a
hook placed on the head of the harness-bridle, and
through a leather loop on the head of the riding-bridle,
and come down on each side of the neck. About
middle-way down the neck is a coupling with two
swivels, which receive the reins from the head, and
they then pass through the dees of the harness, and
through the turrets of the harness-saddle, and along
to the front of the splashboard to a rein-holder, by
which they are held always ready for use. The head
of the horse and the turrets of the saddle being both
higher than the throat, and the coupling being short,
and having leave to traverse the reins on each side of
the neck, it settles on that part of the throat at which
the reins, on being pulled, exert the greatest force,
when, the windpipe being forcibly compressed, the
horse becomes affected in his respiration, and, therefore,
stands still, or slackens his pace for breath, which
he immediately obtains on the reins being slackened.
Thus, feeling he is mastered, the horse shows no farther
inclination to run off again; but in case he should
renew symptoms of starting off, a few firm grips of the
coupling on the throat will let him feel the futility of
his attempts.</p>

<p>In explanation of the origin of the invention, Mr.
Miller stated that he was a farmer's son, and that, in
his youth, he used to be employed at times to assist in
catching horses at grass, by means of surrounding them
with a rope, borne by a person at each end of it. He
remarked that, in this service, although no restraint
was laid upon the horses when the rope rested on their
chests, yet, whenever it could be got upon their throats,
they instantly stood still and allowed themselves to be
taken. The idea which this recollection suggested, of
the probable effect of pressure on the throat in stopping
a runaway horse, led Mr. Miller to the contrivance
of his safety-reins. In his first experiment, the band
which connects the reins under the neck was attached
to the headstall by hooks and straps; but it has
been considered an improvement to allow it to
move freely upon the reins, on which it settles in
contact with the throat, in a proper position for use
when required.</p>

<p>Our communications with Mr. Miller impressed us
favorably in regard to his contrivance; but, wishing
to see it in practice we availed ourselves of an offer
by him to afford us an opportunity of judging of it in
operation. We, accordingly, on a day appointed, accompanied
him in a carriage drawn by one horse, for
the purpose of trial; and we witnessed as spectators,
as well as made ourselves, repeated tests of the reins,
with the horse going at a smart canter, both on a level
road and on a descent, and we invariably observed
that the tightening of the reins caused the horse immediately
to stop. No injurious effect seemed to be
produced on the horse by the interruption of his respiration.
He always appeared to breathe freely, and
to be ready to resume his work, as soon as the tension
of the reins was relaxed.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, therefore, we consider Mr. Miller's
invention to be a neat and simple, as well as, to appearance,
an effective contrivance for the accomplishment
of its important object, in the prevention of the
disastrous accidents which not unfrequently occur
from horses running away; and we think it reflects
much credit on the ingenuity of its inventor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gardeners' Chronicle.</span>&mdash;<i>Rhododendron.</i>&mdash;There is
a variety of the Rhododendron ponticum growing here,
which appears to be different from any of the others.
It comes into flower about the same time as the others,
but instead of unfolding its blossoms at the same rate
as its neighbors, it only opens a few at a time, and
continues long in flower. It did not cease flowering
this season the whole month of August; consequently
was nearly a month longer in bloom than the others.
It has a southern exposure, and is sheltered from the
north and east.</p>

<p><i>Blight on Grain from the Barberry.</i>&mdash;In the Chronicle
of August 19, under the head of "Vulgar Errors,"
we read as follows: "People still maintain that the
barberry blights their grain." This is, nevertheless, a
matter deserving attention; for in this, as in many
other instances, a popular prejudice has been founded
on truth, although the real cause has been often overlooked.
Some writers have treated this subject with
respect, and among them is Dr. Thornton. The latter
says that the "leaves are very subject to the <i>rubigo</i>,
which will infect the grain in the neighborhood." Here
the secret is at once explained, and the aversion of
farmers to the barberry-bush at once justified. The
vulgar notion is, that the barberry exercises some evil
agency upon grain within a certain distance, and accordingly
farmers will never suffer it to grow near
their fields. They are right as to the effect, but they
attribute it to a wrong cause. I have seen some remarkable
instances of grain perishing in a semicircle,
in front of a barberry-bush, and extending a good way
into a field. Any one who has but superficially noticed
the barberry, must have observed that the leaves
and young shoots of the shrub were covered with a
peculiar kind of blight or mildew. Now it is by no
means extraordinary that this should be carried by the
wind into grain-fields, and infect the grain so as to
cause its destruction. This is the true explanation of
the mischief caused by the barberry to grain in its
neighborhood. [This is the common explanation, but
if any one will take the trouble to examine the parasitical
plant which attacks the barberry, and that of
grain, he will find that they are totally different things.
One is the Æcidium Berberidis, and the other some
species of Uredo or Puccinia, for it is sometimes one
and sometimes the other. We should as soon believe
that a hen's egg would be hatched into toads, as that
the seed of an Æcidium would produce an Uredo or
Puccinia. We are aware of the facts mentioned by
Mr. Wighton, for we have seen them ourselves, and
they form a curious problem yet to solve.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks</span>.&mdash;<i>Ashes</i>, since the late news from Europe, have been
in good request. <i>Candles</i>, especially those made of stearic, are
brisk. <i>Cotton</i>. The day after the arrival of the Caledonia with
advices of a fall in England, this article receded nearly ¼ of a
cent per lb.; but a brisk demand springing up for export, it has
recovered, and is about the same now as before the reception of
the late news. We hear nothing particularly new from the south
regarding the picking, the weather upon the whole supposed to be
more favorable. Export from the United States since 1st September
last, 62,450 bales; same time last year, 113,301; same time
year before, 99,904. <i>Flour</i>. The continued navigation on the
canals, has brought us an unprecedented supply, and a large quantity
has gone into store; a good business, however, continues to be
done in it. The total arrivals this season have been 1,440,000 brls.
<i>Rye-flour</i> is dull. <i>Buckwheat</i>, very scarce and advancing. <i>Cornmeal</i>,
dull. <i>Wheat</i> is in good demand, and prices stiff. <i>Rye</i>, declining.
<i>Barley</i>, <i>Oats</i>, and <i>Corn</i>, in fair demand. <i>Hemp</i>, dull.
<i>Hops</i>, improving. <i>Molasses</i>, not much inquired for. <i>Beef</i> and <i>Pork</i>,
quiet, and little doing at present in them. <i>Lard</i>, much wanted.
<i>Hogs</i>. Extreme rates now in Cincinnati are from $2.25 to $2.75;
we are free to repeat, however, that we believe the first quality of
hogs will be worth $3 by Christmas. <i>Rice</i>, of the better qualities,
scarce. <i>Seeds</i>, especially Timothy, in good request. <i>Sugar</i>, quite
inactive. <i>Tobacco</i>, fine Kentucky, scarce and wanted; stems,
none in market. <i>Wool</i> seems to have taken a fresh start again,
and prices have an upward tendency.</p>

<p><i>Stocks</i>. A large business continues to be done in these, and they
are still gradually advancing.</p>

<p><i>Money</i> plenty, and seeking investment at the usual low rates.</p>

<p><i>Real Estate</i> seems at last to have come into demand, and considerable
sales in this species of property have recently taken place
at good prices. It must henceforth advance. Our population and
wealth have increased in an unprecedented ratio within the past
four years, and there is no reason why real estate should remain
at its late low prices, and transactions in it any longer stagnant.</p>

<p><i>Business generally</i>, the past season, has been extremely good;
and we do not hesitate to say, few years can show a greater
amount of substantial profits. We consider the days of darkness
as passed, and we may now look forward to the future with the
brightest anticipations.</p>

<p><i>Packing Pork.</i>&mdash;On this subject we quote from the Cincinnati
Chronicle of 22d November. For the benefit of our distant readers,
who may be disposed to send their orders here for pork, we
give below the pork-merchant's prices for <i>packing</i> this season,
based upon 60 cents per bushel for Turk-Island salt, 87½ cents
for bbls., 28 cents per bushel for Kenhawa fine salt, and 75 cents
to $1.50 per day, for laborers. For receiving, weighing, and cutting
the hogs, a block-fee of 5 cents each.</p>

<p>For packing per bbl., including all charges, $1.60 <i>a</i> $1.75. For
salting 100 lbs. in bulk, including saltpetre for the joints, $1.62 <i>a</i>
$1.75. Smoking per 1.000 lbs., including washing, $1.25. Rendering
lard, 37 <i>a</i> 50 cents per 100 lbs., which does not include the
price of the keg or barrel&mdash;2 to 5 cents is also charged on each
keg or barrel, for nailing the hoops, boring, weighing, and marking.
The cooperage is charged at cost.</p>

<p>A pure-bred imported cow, and a bull of the Galloway or
Kyloe breed of Scotch Highland cattle, are for sale in this vicinity.
These animals are very fine of their kind, and were chosen
from one of the most celebrated breeders of this stock in Scotland.
The cow took several prizes at the agricultural shows before being
shipped to this country, and gives a superior quality of milk. The
bull is quite equal to the cow, and they will be sold at a reasonable
price.</p>

<p>S. &amp; M. publish the following Book, which should be in every
family in the United States: GUNN'S DOMESTIC MEDICINE,
or the Poor Man's Friend.</p>

<p>Among the many publications of more than doubtful utility, with
which our presses groan, it is pleasant to offer to the public one
which, while it can not injure the mental and moral powers, is capable
of improving our health and prolonging our days. It is
now about ten years since this work was first published, since
which time it has passed through many large editions, and the
astonishing number of <i>one hundred thousand</i> copies has been sold
in the southern and western states, and the demand is increasing.</p>

<p>It has just been revised and corrected, containing 900 pages, and
executed in superior style. People may be disposed to smile when
we tell them that they can save money by purchasing this book,
but we think we can satisfy them that such is the fact, In every
family more or less is paid yearly for doctor's bills. A child is
taken with a fever, or some other complaint, and from ignorance
nothing is or can be done effectually to check it. The physician
is called, and a large bill is contracted; whereas, had <span class="smcap">Gunn's
Domestic Medicine</span> been on hand, a remedy could easily have
been found which would have checked the disease in its first stage,
and not only have saved the purse, but perhaps the life.</p></blockquote>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
